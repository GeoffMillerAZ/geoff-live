The decision I would defend hardest is refusing to migrate onto the existing
account structure. Speeding up by landing workloads in an ungoverned target
would have converted a one-time migration into a permanent compliance debt, in
a bank, during the period regulators were paying the most attention. Landing
zone first cost weeks and bought a target where every subsequent workload
arrived already governed.

The second decision was to keep the platform team out of the critical path.
Thirty product teams migrating through a twelve-person team is a queue; thirty
teams migrating through a paved road with policy gates is throughput. That is
the same instinct behind everything else on this page.`,

A platform team can build paved roads and still be the bottleneck, because the
knowledge of when to use which road stays inside the platform team. The CoP
moved that knowledge outward — practitioners from product teams answering each
other, with the platform team present rather than presiding.

The measurable effect showed up somewhere else: onboarding time. Teams stopped
opening tickets to ask which pattern applied, because somebody on their own

      summary: "Every team that hasn't shifted left has shifted luck — they've just moved the discovery of defects, security gaps, and compliance failures to production, where luck decides whether a customer or an auditor finds them first. Shifting left means building correctness in early: policy-as-code gates, automated verification, and deterministic artifacts that fail the build instead of the bank. The alternative to shifting left was never 'move faster' — it was gambling, and quietly hoping the dice land your way.",
      body: `## The thing everyone calls "moving fast" is usually shifting luck

There are two strategies for dealing with software defects, security gaps, and compliance failures. The first is to find them before they reach production. The second is to find them after — and hope luck decides it's a developer who finds them, not a customer or an auditor.

Most teams choose the second strategy without realizing it. They call it "moving fast."

Shifting left is not a philosophy. It is a set of concrete engineering choices that move the discovery of failures from production to the build pipeline. The choices are not complicated. What they require is that you stop treating correctness as somebody else's problem and start building it into every artifact the pipeline produces.

## What shifting left actually looks like

**Policy-as-code gates** are the most durable form of shifting left at the infrastructure layer. When a Terraform plan runs through OPA or Sentinel before it applies, you cannot ship a misconfigured S3 bucket to production. The policy runs on every plan, against every branch, before any human reviews anything. The rule doesn't get tired on a Friday afternoon.

At First Citizens Bank, running 100+ AWS accounts across FFIEC, PCI-DSS, and SOC 2 requirements, policy-as-code wasn't optional — it was the only realistic way to maintain continuous compliance posture without a dedicated human reviewing every resource change. The alternative was a quarterly audit that found problems months after they were introduced.

**Automated verification with competing incentives** takes this further into the agentic tier. When an agent authors a configuration change, a separate verifier agent — with different system context and different incentives — audits the output before it lands. The verifier isn't trying to help the author; it's trying to find holes. That adversarial relationship is the point.

**Deterministic artifacts** close the gap between "it worked in CI" and "it worked in production." A container image that is reproducibly built from a pinned base, signed, and hash-verified at deploy time is not the same artifact as one that was built from <code>latest</code> on a developer laptop. Reproducibility is not a performance optimization. It is a correctness property.

## The asymmetry nobody talks about

The cost of finding a defect scales exponentially with how far right it travels.

A failed unit test costs thirty seconds. A failed policy gate costs a pipeline re-run. A security gap found in a pre-prod environment costs a day of remediation. The same gap found by a PCI auditor costs six figures and a project freeze.

Every team knows this asymmetry intellectually. Most don't act on it, because the pain of a build failure is immediate and the benefit of preventing a production incident is counterfactual. You never see the incident that didn't happen.

The teams that shift left consistently have usually experienced the alternative: a data breach, a compliance finding, a production incident caused by a misconfiguration that was visible in the diff for two weeks before anyone noticed. Once you've paid that tax, the thirty-second pipeline failure feels like a bargain.

## What "move faster" actually requires

Here is the uncomfortable truth: shifting left is what actually makes teams move faster. Not in the first week. In the third month.

A team that ships correct, policy-compliant, reproducibly-built artifacts doesn't spend its Friday afternoons on emergency rollbacks. It doesn't spend its Q3 on a remediation sprint after an audit finding. It doesn't lose two engineers for a month tracking down a production bug that was visible in the test suite if anyone had looked.

The teams I've watched move the fastest over a sustained period are the ones where the pipeline is the floor, not the ceiling. Where a green build is a meaningful signal, not a formality. Where the definition of "done" includes "verified by something that doesn't share your assumptions."

      summary: "Raw LLM calls are not an engineering platform. An agentic-kit is the governed harness that sits between your agents and production: budget guards, injection detection, replay-tested determinism, competing-incentive verification, and provenance journaling. Without it you have demos; with it you have software you can put in front of a regulated enterprise.",
      body: `## The demo problem

Every agentic system looks great in a demo. The model is smart, the tool calls are plausible, the output is coherent. Then you put it in front of a production workload and discover that "coherent" and "correct" are not the same thing — and that there is nothing between the model's output and your infrastructure to tell the difference.

Raw LLM calls are not an engineering platform. They are a capability. An agentic-kit is the governed harness that turns that capability into software you can actually put in front of a regulated enterprise.

## The governed agent loop

The architecture that works — the one I built agentic-kit around — has a specific shape. Every agent interaction flows through the same loop:

- **Model turn.** The model receives context and produces either a message or a tool call request.
- **Tool dispatch.** Tool calls are routed through a registry that validates the call signature, checks the caller's current budget, and logs the intent before dispatch.
- **Governance screens.** Before execution, the tool call passes through the endpoint guard. This is where injection detection runs, where the strike ledger is checked, and where proof-of-work challenges can be imposed on suspicious callers.

The endpoint guard is fail-closed. If it cannot make a trust decision — network partition, schema mismatch, budget exhaustion — the call does not execute. The default behavior is denial, not permissiveness. This is the opposite of what most teams build when they wire up tool calling for the first time, and it is the difference that matters in a regulated environment.

## The strike ledger and circuit breaker

Not all failures are equal. An agent that makes one malformed tool call might have hit a transient edge case. An agent that makes fifteen unusual tool calls in rapid succession is doing something that deserves human attention.

The strike ledger in agentic-kit maintains a per-agent, per-session record of governance events: injection attempts, budget warnings, schema violations, repeated failures. The circuit breaker watches this record and applies escalating responses — from rate limiting, to proof-of-work challenges that slow down automated callers, to full session suspension pending review.

The proof-of-work mechanism is particularly useful against prompt injection. An attacker who has convinced an agent to call a forbidden endpoint will find that the endpoint guard responds with a computational challenge before proceeding. Automated injection pipelines fail this reliably. A legitimate agent call, where a human is in the loop, can satisfy it with minimal friction.

## Replay determinism and hash-chained provenance

One of the hardest properties to add to an agentic system after the fact is replay determinism — the ability to re-run a past interaction and verify that the same inputs produce the same outputs. Without it, you cannot debug production failures, you cannot write meaningful regression tests, and you cannot satisfy an auditor who wants to know exactly what the agent did and why.

agentic-kit journals every interaction in a format that can be replayed: the model version, the full context, the tool calls made, and the responses received. These records are hash-chained — each entry includes the hash of the previous entry — so the chain cannot be modified without invalidating everything downstream of the edit. Provenance is not a log you add at the end. It is a property of the interaction design from the start.

## Competing-incentive verification

The most reliable verification strategy I know of is adversarial: have a second agent, with different system context and explicitly different incentives, audit the first agent's output before it executes.

The verifier is not trying to help the author. It is trying to find holes — places where the output violates schema, where a configuration change would open a security gap, where the logic is correct but the intent is ambiguous. Because the verifier's context is sourced from outside the author's repository, it cannot be fooled by a corrupt source that also corrupts the verifier.

This pattern — author/verifier with competing incentives — is what I run at PayPal for agentic code review gates. The author agent proposes. The verifier audits. A human sees a recommendation, not a raw model output. The tripling of throughput we see is not because the agents write code faster; it is because the feedback loop on correctness is tighter, and we spend less time on rework.

## Why you need the kit before you need more agents

The temptation is to add agents first and governance later. The problem is that governance shapes what the agents can safely do. An agentic system built without a budget cap will spend without bound. One built without injection detection will be compromised by a sufficiently creative prompt. One without provenance journaling will be un-debuggable when something goes wrong.

Build the kit first. Then the agents you add on top of it are software — verifiable, auditable, deployable in a regulated environment. Without the kit, they are demos.`,

      body: `## Keystrokes are no longer the bottleneck

For most of software engineering history, the binding constraint on output was how fast a human could write code. Every productivity tool — IDEs, snippets, frameworks, generators — attacked the same problem: reduce the number of keystrokes between intent and working software.

Agentic coding dissolves that constraint almost completely. A well-prompted agent writes a thousand lines of plausible code faster than any human. The bottleneck shifts: now the scarce resource is **consistency**. When a hundred agent-generated screens can each express a slightly different visual language, component contract, or data shape, you don't have a product — you have a museum of adjacent implementation choices.

An app-kit is the answer to that specific problem. It gives humans and agents one set of paved roads.

## The CUE design-token pipeline

app-kit's design system is expressed in CUE — a typed configuration language that validates its own constraints at definition time. The token definitions flow through a pipeline that compiles them into three simultaneous targets: CSS custom properties for the browser layer, a DTCG-format JSON bundle for design tools, and Go constants for server-side rendering.

The key property here is **single source of truth**. When the accent color changes, it changes in one place — the CUE definition — and the pipeline propagates the change everywhere. An agent generating a new component doesn't need to know the current accent hex code; it reads from the token vocabulary, which is always correct because it can't drift from itself.

This matters especially for agentic code generation. Agents that work without typed token contracts tend to hardcode colors, reach into CSS files directly, or make up values that look plausible. A typed token vocabulary with an MCP surface makes the right choice the easy choice: the agent queries the kit for <code>--color-accent</code> and gets the current value, not the value from some document it was trained on.

## Pure-Go visualization, no Node dependency

One of the deliberate constraints in app-kit is the elimination of Node.js from any critical path. The visualization layer — charts, graphs, SVG-based data displays — is implemented in pure Go, generating SVG markup server-side with no JavaScript dependency for the base rendering.

This is not an ideological stance against JavaScript. It is a practical stance against supply chain complexity. A pure-Go SVG visualization library has one build toolchain, one language ecosystem, and one set of CVE exposure. It deploys as a single binary. It runs in environments where Node is not available — Lambda functions, embedded edge workers, air-gapped build pipelines.

When an agent generates a data visualization, it calls into the Go library and gets an SVG it can embed. There is no webpack configuration to get wrong, no npm audit to run, no Node version to pin.

## The MCP component server

The most important surface in app-kit for agentic use is the MCP component server. It exposes the component library — every card, button, form, layout primitive, and page shell — through a Model Context Protocol interface that agents can query.

An agent building a new screen doesn't browse source files or guess at component names. It sends a query to the MCP server: <code>list_components</code>, <code>get_component_by_name("DataCard")</code>, <code>get_component_preview</code>. The server responds with the component's interface, its expected props, and a rendered example. The agent then composes from the vocabulary it discovers, not from the vocabulary it imagines.

The consequence is measurable: screens generated through the MCP surface look and behave consistently because they share components with every other screen in the product. The divergence problem — a hundred agents producing a hundred visual languages — is structurally prevented rather than reviewed away.

## The loopback/app contract

Every app built on app-kit has a defined contract for how the frontend and the backend communicate in development and in production. In development, that contract is satisfied over a local loopback — the same Go server that handles production traffic also handles local development, with no proxy, no mock layer, no external dev server.

This matters for agents because it means the environment an agent develops in is structurally identical to the environment that will run in production. There is no "it works locally" failure mode caused by a difference between the dev proxy and the production router. The seam between local and production is an adapter swap, not an environment difference.

## What the kit actually prevents

Without an app-kit, agentic coding produces inconsistency at scale. Every agent makes locally reasonable choices that compound into global chaos: different button styles, different form validation patterns, different error state representations, different data fetching idioms. Human reviewers spend their time on visual inconsistency instead of logic correctness.

With an app-kit, the agents have one vocabulary, one design language, and one way to compose screens. Human reviewers look at whether the agent used the right component for the job — not whether it invented a new component that looks almost like the right one.

The kit is not about constraining agents. It is about directing their creativity to the layer that matters: the problem being solved, not the infrastructure for solving it.`,

Hexagonal design turns 'the agent rewrote half the app' into 'the agent swapped one adapter.'",
      body: `## The coupling problem in agentic code generation

When an agent writes code without architectural constraints, it tends to couple everything to everything. Database calls appear in route handlers. Business logic appears in database models. AWS SDK calls appear in what was supposed to be a pure computation function. This isn't a failure of the model's intelligence — it is a consequence of asking the model to make local decisions without a global structural rule.

The coupling that results is not just aesthetically displeasing. It is specifically hostile to the operations that agentic engineering depends on: replay testing, verification, adapter swaps, and deterministic re-execution. A system where the domain logic is fused to the delivery mechanism cannot be replayed in isolation. It cannot be verified without its full infrastructure dependency tree. It cannot be tested without a real database.

Hexagonal architecture — ports and adapters — solves this problem structurally, not through discipline.

## Domain core and port definitions

The center of a hexagonal system is the domain core: pure business logic, expressed in the language's type system, with no imports from infrastructure packages. In Go, this means the core package has no AWS SDK imports, no database drivers, no HTTP client calls. It defines **ports** — interfaces that describe what the core needs from the outside world.

~~~
type AgentRepository interface {
    Store(ctx context.Context, run AgentRun) error
    Load(ctx context.Context, id RunID) (AgentRun, error)
}

type GovernancePolicy interface {
    Evaluate(ctx context.Context, call ToolCall) Decision
}
~~~

These interfaces compile and test without any infrastructure present. An agent given this port definition has a precise, bounded contract to implement adapters against. It cannot accidentally couple the domain to DynamoDB because DynamoDB is not imported in the domain package.

## Adapters as the only moving part

Adapters implement the ports. A <code>DynamoAgentRepository</code> implements <code>AgentRepository</code> using DynamoDB. A <code>LocalAgentRepository</code> implements the same interface using an in-memory map. A <code>LambdaGovernancePolicy</code> calls an AWS Lambda function. A <code>LoopbackGovernancePolicy</code> makes a local HTTP call to the same process.

The domain core is unchanged across all of these. The same governed-agent loop that runs in production Lambda runs locally over loopback — the only difference is which adapter is wired at startup. In practice, this means:

- Local development has zero AWS cost and zero AWS dependency
- Integration tests run against local adapters with full domain coverage
- Production deploys swap in the cloud adapters with no domain code changes
- An agent developing a new feature can work entirely against the local adapter and be confident the domain logic will behave identically in production

## Adapter boundaries as replay and verification seams

Every adapter boundary is a natural seam for replay testing. Because adapters are injected through interfaces, they can be replaced with recording adapters that capture interactions — and replaying adapters that replay them.

In practice, this is how I test governed-agent interactions: run the real interaction once, record every domain call at the adapter boundary, then replay the recording in CI to verify that the same inputs produce the same outputs without touching any real infrastructure. This is exact replay determinism, and it is structurally free in a hexagonal architecture. In a system where domain logic is coupled to infrastructure, achieving the same property requires mocking at the SDK level, which is fragile and expensive to maintain.

Verification fits the same pattern. A verifier agent that receives an <code>AgentRun</code> from the repository adapter is working with the same typed domain object that the author agent produced. The verification logic can run against the local adapter, against a production snapshot, or against a replayed recording. The seam is always in the same place.

## What agents can and cannot touch

One of the underappreciated benefits of hexagonal architecture for agentic engineering is the clarity it provides about scope. When an agent is asked to add a new feature, the question "what files should I touch?" has a clear structural answer: if the feature is domain logic, it lives in the core; if it is delivery, it lives in an adapter; if it bridges them, it defines a new port.

An agent that follows this rule cannot accidentally rewrite the HTTP router while trying to fix a business logic bug. The two concerns live in different packages with no import path connecting them. The worst an agent can do when asked to change domain behavior is change the domain package and the tests that cover it — which is exactly the scope that should change.

This turns "the agent rewrote half the app" into "the agent swapped one adapter and added a port method." The blast radius is bounded by the architecture, not by the agent's judgment about what is safe to touch.

## The Go choice

Hexagonal architecture works in any language, but Go makes it unusually clean. Interfaces are structural, not declared — any type that implements the methods satisfies the interface without needing to import it. This means adapters have zero import-coupling to the domain; the domain defines the interface, adapters implement it, and the compiler verifies the match at build time.

For agentic code generation, Go's explicit interfaces and lack of magic make generated code easier to verify: if it compiles, the adapter contract is satisfied. There is no duck-typing ambiguity, no runtime interface discovery, no framework reflection. The type system is the governance layer for structural correctness.`,

      summary: "Agents are far more reliable when they emit structured data than freeform prose. CUE gives you one typed schema that validates that data, unifies configuration, and compiles to JSON, YAML, or Go — so drift between what the schema says and what the agent produced becomes a build failure instead of a production incident. It is the single source of truth that makes agent output deterministic and defensible.",
      body: `## The freeform prose problem

The cheapest way to get an agent to produce structured output is to ask it nicely in the system prompt: "respond with JSON in this shape." The success rate is high enough to feel reliable. Then you hit a production edge case — a long response that trips the context window, a schema field the model found ambiguous, a tool call that returned an unexpected value — and the JSON is malformed, or the shape is subtly wrong, or the model silently dropped a required field.

Asking nicely is not a schema. A schema is a constraint that makes the wrong shape impossible to produce — or at least impossible to pass without being caught.

CUE is that constraint. It is a typed configuration language whose validation logic is expressed in the same syntax as the data it validates. When an agent's output passes CUE evaluation, the schema says so mechanically, not probabilistically. When it fails, the error is precise, actionable, and available before the output reaches any system that would act on it.

## CUE as contract between agent and system

In agentic-kit and app-kit, CUE schemas serve as the contract between what an agent is allowed to produce and what downstream systems will accept. The schema is defined once, in a <code>.cue</code> file that is version-controlled alongside the code it governs. Any output the agent produces is evaluated against it before use.

The evaluation is not a JSON Schema validation pass (though CUE can export JSON Schema). It is a type unification: CUE's evaluation model treats the schema and the data as two values being merged, and produces either a unified result or a type error. This means constraints compose — you can layer a base schema, a feature-specific schema, and an environment-specific override, and CUE will evaluate all of them simultaneously and report conflicts precisely.

For agent output, this matters because agents produce outputs that satisfy multiple overlapping constraints: the tool call schema, the governance policy, the application domain contract, and the environment configuration. CUE handles all of these in one evaluation pass. A Python validator chain handles them sequentially, in an order that may hide conflicts.

## Unifying configuration: one schema, three targets

The design token pipeline in app-kit illustrates CUE's most practical property: a single schema definition that compiles to multiple target formats simultaneously.

The token schema is defined in CUE. A <code>cue export</code> command with the appropriate mappings produces:

- **CSS custom properties** for the browser layer (<code>--color-accent: #c084fc;</code>)
- **DTCG-format JSON** for design tooling
- **Go constants** for server-side rendering and Go clients

All three are derived from the same source. When the schema changes, all three change in sync. An agent generating a new component queries the CSS layer. A Go backend reads constants from the generated package. A design tool reads the DTCG bundle. None of them can drift from the others because they share a common origin that is enforced at build time.

**Drift = build failure** is the key property. If the CSS and the Go constants diverge, the build fails before anything is deployed. This is not something a code review or a linter can reliably catch — it requires a mechanical check that runs on every change.

## CUE as agent output validator

The most direct use of CUE in an agentic system is as the output validator in the governance loop. After the model turn produces a tool call or a structured response, before the endpoint guard allows dispatch, the output is evaluated against the CUE schema for that tool.

A tool call that would write a Kubernetes manifest passes CUE evaluation for the manifest schema. If the agent produced a <code>Deployment</code> with a missing <code>selector</code>, the evaluation fails with a specific field-level error. The call does not dispatch. The agent receives the error and can attempt correction.

This changes the failure mode from "the agent produced a subtly wrong manifest that deployed successfully and caused a production incident six days later" to "the agent produced a wrong manifest and got an immediate, specific error that it corrected on the next turn." The first failure mode is expensive. The second is a normal part of the agentic loop.

## Compiling to Go: type safety across the boundary

One of CUE's underused features is its ability to generate Go struct definitions from a CUE schema. In a Go-backed agentic system, this means the same schema that validates agent output also defines the Go types that the domain core works with.

When the schema changes, <code>cue generate</code> produces updated Go types. If the domain code uses a field that the schema removed, the Go compiler fails. The schema and the implementation are mechanically coupled — they cannot drift because drift is a compile error.

For agentic engineering, this closes the last gap in the type safety chain: the model produces JSON that satisfies the CUE schema, the CUE schema generates the Go types, and the Go compiler verifies that the domain logic handles those types correctly. The schema is not documentation. It is the load-bearing constraint that makes the system defensible.

## CUE's limitations and where it earns its complexity

CUE has a learning curve. Its unification model is not immediately intuitive for engineers coming from JSON Schema or YAML. The toolchain is Go-based and has opinions about module layout. Error messages can be dense.

These are real costs. They are worth paying when:

- You have agent output that must satisfy multiple overlapping constraints
- You have configuration that must compile to multiple target formats without drift
- You need a build-time guarantee that schema and implementation agree
- You are operating in a regulated environment where "the model said so" is not a sufficient audit trail

If you only need one of these properties, a lighter tool may suffice. If you need all of them — and in a serious agentic engineering platform you will — CUE is the right backbone, not because it is the most ergonomic choice, but because it is the one that makes the wrong outputs structurally impossible rather than merely unlikely.`,

      body: `## The non-prod spend problem nobody measures

Cloud cost optimization discussions tend to focus on production: reserved instances, savings plans, spot fleets, rightsizing running workloads. These are real levers. They are also the hardest levers to pull, because production changes carry reliability risk and require change management overhead that slows everything down.

Non-production environments are a different story. They are idle most of the time — nights, weekends, the three hours between a deploy and the next review. They are often over-provisioned because nobody wants to be the person who made the dev environment too small. And they rarely have cost accountability because the teams that run them are measured on delivery, not on spend.

At multiple organizations, I've seen non-prod account for 60–75% of total cloud spend. That is not a misconfiguration. It is the predictable consequence of treating non-prod infrastructure as a permanent fixture rather than an on-demand resource.

The event-driven teardown and spin-up pattern changes that accounting directly.

## The architecture: EventBridge as the orchestration layer

The core of the pattern is simple: non-prod environments are not always-on resources. They exist when something needs them, and they don't when nothing does.

AWS EventBridge provides the event backbone. Three categories of events drive the automation:

**PR lifecycle events.** A GitHub webhook (delivered to an EventBridge partner bus) fires when a pull request is opened, updated, or closed. On open or update, a Step Functions workflow provisions the environment — or confirms it is already running. On close or merge, the same workflow begins the teardown sequence: drain connections, snapshot state if needed, terminate instances.

**Idle detection events.** CloudWatch metrics on ECS task CPU, RDS connection count, and ALB request rate feed custom EventBridge rules. When all three metrics fall below threshold for a configurable window (typically 45 minutes), an idle-detected event fires and the teardown workflow runs. The environment can be re-created on the next PR open or manual trigger.

**Schedule events.** For environments that don't use PR-driven lifecycle (shared integration environments, QA environments with unpredictable use patterns), a scheduled EventBridge rule tears down at end-of-business and spins up before business hours. This is the least sophisticated option and the most reliable — even without perfect idle detection, you don't pay for environments overnight.

## Tag-driven right-sizing

Provisioning from scratch on every PR open is expensive if every environment is sized for peak production load. Tag-driven right-sizing addresses this.

Every non-prod resource is tagged with an <code>env-tier</code> value: <code>dev</code>, <code>integration</code>, or <code>staging</code>. The provisioning workflow reads this tag and selects a sizing profile — instance types, ECS task memory, RDS instance class — appropriate for the tier. A <code>dev</code> environment gets 20% of the compute resources of a <code>staging</code> environment.

The sizing profiles are defined in a central SSM Parameter Store path and referenced by all provisioning templates. Changing the <code>dev</code> tier profile changes every dev environment on its next provision cycle. No template updates, no per-environment configuration drift.

Right-sizing accounts for a meaningful portion of the total savings on its own. But the larger impact comes from eliminating the idle hours entirely — an on-demand dev environment that runs four hours a day and is correctly-sized is where the 70%+ number comes from.

## Cost attribution that actually works

The prerequisite for any FinOps program is knowing what you're spending and on what. AWS Cost Explorer is the tool, but it is only as useful as your tagging discipline.

The tagging schema I run everywhere has four required tags on every resource:

- <code>team</code> — the team that owns the resource
- <code>environment</code> — dev, integration, staging, or prod
- <code>service</code> — the service or workload name
- <code>cost-center</code> — the internal cost center for chargeback

These four tags, enforced through AWS Config rules and OPA policies on the Terraform state, produce Cost Explorer views that answer "who is spending what on which service in which environment" without any manual reconciliation.

When you can see that a specific team's dev environments are running idle for 14 hours a day and representing 40% of that team's monthly bill, the conversation about implementing teardown automation becomes easy. The data makes the case.

## The dashboard that drives the behavior

The final piece is visibility. Event-driven teardown automation that runs silently produces savings that nobody sees and therefore nobody defends when the next "let's just leave it running" decision comes up.

A FinOps dashboard — CloudWatch Dashboard with Cost Explorer API feeds — shows the current running non-prod environments and their hourly cost, environments torn down in the last 24 hours and hours saved, rolling 30-day non-prod spend versus the baseline before the pattern was implemented, and an alert when an environment has been running for more than 8 hours without PR activity.

The dashboard is visible to teams and to leadership. It turns cost optimization from an invisible infrastructure concern into a concrete, visible engineering metric. Teams that see their own spend tend to care about it.

## What 70%+ actually means

The 70%+ non-prod spend reduction figure comes from real deployments of this pattern across multiple organizations. The range varies:

- Teams with heavy weekend development activity see smaller savings, because the environments were legitimately in use.
- Teams with strict 9-to-5 working patterns and long-lived dev environments see savings closer to the high end.
- Organizations with globally distributed teams where "business hours" spans multiple time zones see the largest gains — idle detection catches the gap hours between shifts.

The savings accrue without any change to developer workflow for teams using PR-driven lifecycle. A developer opens a PR and the environment appears. The environment disappears when the PR closes. From the developer's perspective, the environment is always there when they need it. From the platform's perspective, it was idle for 18 hours last night and the bill reflects that.

That asymmetry — invisible to users, visible in spend — is what makes the pattern durable. It doesn't require behavior change. It requires infrastructure that aligns cost with actual use.`,

It is\ntransmitted at onboarding, reinforced in review when someone happens to notice,\nand audited long after the code shipped. A harness moves it from memory into\nmechanism.\n\n## Only approved tooling — read from the platform's own docs\n\nA model reaching for a library has seen the popular one a million times in\ntraining and the organisation's standardised one approximately never. Left\nalone it will confidently pick the wrong thing, and the wrongness surfaces at\nreview, at security sign-off, or in production.\n\nThe harness researches the platform's documentation through the **Confluence\nMCP** and constrains generation to what the organisation has actually approved.\nThis matters more than a static allow-list: the approved set is a living\ndocument owned by the platform organisation, so reading it means the harness\ntracks approvals as they change instead of encoding a snapshot that starts\nrotting the day it is written.\n\nThe check then runs at the pre-commit border, which is the difference between\nfinding out in seconds and finding out in a review thread three days later.\n\n## Testing standards, at every layer the service owes\n\nTesting standards rarely fail because tests are missing. They fail because the\nwrong layers are present — a large unit suite, no contract test against the\nservice this thing actually calls, and an integration suite that has not run\nsince it was written.\n\nThe harness knows which layers a given kind of service owes and requires all of\nthem, applies coverage where coverage means something, and checks that the tests\nexercise the change rather than passing beside it. A suite that goes green\nwithout touching the new code is a signal with nothing behind it, and that is\nworse than no signal, because people trust it.\n\n## Commit hooks, installed rather than documented\n\nHooks are the cheapest enforcement available and the most commonly skipped,\nbecause installing them is a manual step in a README that a fresh clone does not\nperform. The harness installs the set — formatting, lint, secret scanning,\ndependency allow-list, traceability — so the check exists on every clone with\nnobody opting in.\n\nSecret scanning is the one that justifies the whole mechanism on its own: it is\nthe single class of mistake that cannot be taken back once it crosses the\nborder.\n\n## Deployment and cloud practice, from the golden path\n\nRollout strategy, health gating, rollback, tagging, encryption, network posture,\ncost guardrails and observability are all things every team re-derives, slightly\ndifferently, and slightly wrong. The harness takes them from the platform's\ngolden path so the deployment shape is the platform's answer rather than each\nteam's reconstruction of it.\n\n## Evidence generated, not written afterwards\n\nArchitecture and logging documentation are produced as structured artifacts from\nthe change itself, so an approval board receives a consistent artifact instead of\na document each author invents under deadline. Governance stops being a queue\nand becomes something a change arrives already carrying."

The meta-harness is the one that makes it work\nat more than one team.\n\n## Why building harnesses has to be cheap\n\nA governed environment built by hand takes real effort — someone has to encode\nthe standards, wire the hooks, express the test matrix, encode the deployment\npatterns, and keep all of it current. Do that once and you have helped one team.\nDo it for twelve and you have created a full-time department that nobody\nbudgeted for, whose output goes stale the moment the standards move.\n\nSo the interesting artifact is not any individual harness. It is the thing that\nwrites them: the meta-harness reads the organisational standards, the platform\ndocumentation and a team's own conventions, and produces that team's harness.\n\n## What that changes\n\n- **Coverage stops being political.** When a harness is expensive, the team that\n  gets one is the team that escalated. When it is cheap, every team gets one, and\n  the standards apply where they were always supposed to apply.\n- **A policy change becomes a regeneration.** In the usual model a new control\n  costs an announcement, a wiki edit, a quarter of drift and a follow-up audit.\n  Here it costs a rebuild, and the next change any team makes is already\n  compliant with it.\n- **Local difference survives.** Team conventions stay an explicit input, so a\n  shared harness does not flatten every team into one house style. Repository\n  shape and required test layers legitimately differ; security and compliance\n  requirements do not.\n- **The standards get read rather than remembered.** Because the inputs are the\n  organisation's own living documents, the harness reflects what the platform\n  currently approves rather than what someone believed at authoring time.\n\n## The honest limit\n\nNone of this makes an agent correct. It makes an agent's output *conformant*,\nand it makes non-conformance fail early and cheaply. Design judgement, whether\nthe thing being built is the right thing at all, and whether a test suite is\nactually testing the risk — those remain human, and the point of removing\nconformance work from a reviewer's attention is to give it back to exactly those\nquestions."

The specialist bottleneck is real, and it is not a knowledge problem\n— it is a *serialisation* problem.\n\n## What the harness removes\n\nEach of those questions is answered by a gate that runs, at the border where the\nanswer matters. The unapproved package fails in seconds on the developer's own\nmachine. The missing test layer never reaches review. The hook is already\ninstalled. The deployment pattern comes from the golden path. The board's\nartifact arrives with the change.\n\nNone of that is faster typing. It is the removal of waiting, and of the rework\nthat follows a late no.\n\n## What is left for the humans\n\nReviewer attention moves off conformance and onto design — which is the only\npart that needed a person, and the part that was getting the least attention\nprecisely because conformance was consuming the review.\n\nThat is also why this is worth building carefully rather than quickly. A gate\nthat is wrong is worse than no gate: it teaches people to route around it, and a\nrouted-around gate is a false assurance that an auditor will eventually find."

Building them from a single\nextraction means they cannot.\n\n## The edge that makes it work\n\nThe dashed line on the diagram — readiness findings flowing back into the expert\nsystems — is the part I would defend hardest in an interview.\n\nAn assistant that has read the code can tell you what a service does. An\nassistant that has also been told *this service retries three times with no\njitter, and its caller's timeout is shorter than its own* can tell you what is\nprobably happening right now.

Nothing here takes an action on production.\nThe expert systems recommend and cite; the dashboard organises humans; the\nreadiness scan reports.

Discovered at 3am, while paging someone who left.\n\n## Why this is hard to do by reading\n\nNone of these are visible in a code review, because no individual file looks\nwrong. The retry in the client is reasonable. The platform retry is reasonable.\nThe timeout is reasonable. The failure is in the composition, and the\ncomposition is spread across a repository, a Helm chart and a service mesh\npolicy that three different teams own.\n\nExtraction into a common form is what makes the comparison mechanical instead of\ndepending on one engineer who happens to hold all three in their head.\n\n## Citations at extraction time\n\nEvery observation carries the file and line it came from, captured when it is\nextracted rather than reconstructed when it is cited.\n\nThis sounds like a detail and is the whole difference between a tool people may\nact on and a tool people may only consult.

They are written back into the expert\nsystem for the scope they belong to, which is the thing the duty officer is\nalready talking to.\n\n## What that changes at 3am\n\nWithout it, the assistant answers: *this service calls the payments API, here is\nits timeout configuration.* Accurate and unhelpful.\n\nWith it: *this service calls the payments API with a two-second timeout, which is\nshorter than the payments API's own five-second timeout, and it retries three\ntimes with no jitter. If payments is slow, this service is generating four\ntimes its normal load against it right now.*\n\nThe second answer is not smarter. It has just been told something a scan worked\nout weeks ago, at a moment when nobody has time to work it out again.\n\n## The same catalogue is a fix list\n\nThe findings also go back to the teams that own the configuration, which makes\nthis a prevention loop rather than only a response one. The cheapest incident is\nthe one that never fires, and a finding with a file, a line and a named failure\nmode is a fixable ticket rather than a vague reliability initiative.\n\n## The honest limit\n\nThis finds failure modes that are *declared*. A resource created outside the\ndeclared configuration, a setting changed by hand in a console, a behaviour that\nexists only at runtime — those are outside what a configuration scan can see,\nand the catalogue does not pretend otherwise. Claiming a scan of intent is a\nscan of reality is exactly the kind of overreach that makes an SRE org stop\ntrusting a tool."

An acknowledgement means a device woke somebody;\nit does not mean they are on the call, and it certainly does not mean they are\nawake enough to be useful.\n\nThe gap between acknowledged and joined is where incidents quietly stall,\nbecause it looks identical to help having arrived. Showing the three separately\nmeans the commander can escalate on the right signal instead of discovering\ntwenty minutes later that the database expert acknowledged and went back to\nsleep.\n\n## Impact, maintained rather than re-answered\n\nEvery executive who joins a Sev1 asks the same first question: what is the\nimpact right now. Answering it is not hard; answering it eleven times, from the\nincident commander, while they are also running the incident, is a real tax on\nthe person least able to pay it.\n\nHolding a current impact statement in one visible place converts that from an\ninterruption into a glance.\n\n## Action items belong to the lane that produced them\n\nA decision made in a lane, captured in that lane, with an owner and a state.\nTwo consequences: nothing is assumed to be someone else's, and the\npost-incident timeline writes itself — because the decisions were recorded when\nthey were made rather than reconstructed afterwards from a chat scrollback by\nsomebody who was not there.\n\n## What it deliberately does not do\n\nIt does not diagnose, and it does not act.

          "body": "This is the page I would most want to be asked about, because it is where\nopinion turns into architecture.\n\n## The failure mode of most agentic tooling\n\nThe usual arc: a demo is convincing, the tool ships, and then somebody senior\nasks the only question that matters — *how do we know this is right?* At that\npoint the honest answer is that the model said so, and the tool quietly becomes\nsomething people consult for ideas rather than something they act on.\n\nThe trap is that evidence looks like a presentation problem. It is not. If\ncitations are not captured at the moment a fact is extracted, they cannot be\nrecovered later; asking a model to justify an answer it has already produced\ngenerates plausible references rather than real ones.\n\n## Determinism is a debugging property\n\nThe instinct with a capable model is to let it do everything. The result is a\npipeline where every stage can vary, nothing can be unit tested, and a wrong\nanswer cannot be localised — you cannot tell whether extraction, retrieval or\nreasoning was at fault, so you tune the prompt and hope.\n\nSo parsing, extraction, dependency resolution and the failure-mode checks are\nordinary deterministic code. The model is used where judgement is genuinely\nrequired — interpreting prose, reconciling fragments, explaining a finding in\ncontext. That boundary is what makes the system debuggable, and being debuggable\nis what makes it improvable.\n\n## Reproducibility is how you measure anything\n\nIf the same corpus can produce different expert systems on different days, you\nhave lost the ability to distinguish a change in the system from a change in the\nrun. Every quality claim after that point is unfalsifiable, including the ones\nthat are true.\n\n## Scope, and why one big index is the wrong shape\n\nFlattening everything into one index is the fastest way to a demo and the\nslowest way to a trustworthy answer. Scoped systems keep answers precise, make\nfan-out an explicit and bounded operation, and give access control something to\nattach to. In a regulated organisation the last of those arrives on day one, and\nretrofitting partitioning onto a flattened index is a rewrite.\n\n## Recommend, never act — and how that changes\n\nNothing here touches production. That is not timidity; it is sequencing. The\nhonest path to autonomy runs recommend → assist → act, and each step is earned\nagainst an accumulated record of recommendations that turned out to be correct.\n\nThe useful consequence is that the record is being accumulated already: every\nanswer the duty-officer chat gives during a real incident is a prediction that\neither held up or did not. That is the dataset an argument for more autonomy\nwould eventually have to be made from — and building it before making the\nargument is the difference between earning trust and asking for it."

It is\nthat the savings are already sitting there in plain arithmetic, that schedules\ncapture them only for organisations shaped a particular way, and that the\ndefault is the thing worth changing.\n\n## The gap is arithmetic, not a projection\n\nA non-production environment needed during business hours is used for roughly\n40 hours a week. Left alone, it bills for 168. That ratio is not a vendor claim\nor a case study — it is what a week contains, and AWS quotes exactly those two\nnumbers in its own Instance Scheduler documentation, along with the **up to 76%**\nsaving that follows from closing the gap.\n\nWhich is why the chart above has no trend line in it. There is nothing to\nforecast. The only question a platform team actually faces is whether the\ndefault is *on* or *off*, and everything else is a consequence of that choice.\n\n## Why the published median understates this for a bank\n\nVantage's Q1 2025 report puts non-production at **23% of cloud spend** across\nthousands of connected accounts. That number is real, and it is also the wrong\nnumber to plan a regulated estate against, because the median company in that\nsample runs three environments and a bank does not.\n\nCount the tiers a regulated FinTech actually operates: development, system\nintegration test, user acceptance test, a performance tier that has to be\nproduction-sized to be worth anything, a DR tier that exists to be proven, and\nincreasingly a preview environment per team. Six tiers, most of them held near\nproduction parity — because when an auditor asks where a control was tested,\n\"in something a quarter the size of production\" is a finding rather than an\nanswer.\n\nSix near-parity tiers at even a third of production each is already 200% of the\nproduction bill. In the estates I have run, non-production has consistently been\nthe larger half. I have not found a published benchmark that says so, which is\nwhy the second bar in that chart is labelled as my estimate rather than dressed\nup as research. The mechanism, though, is not in doubt: the median is low\nbecause most companies have few environments, and compliance is precisely the\nthing that multiplies environments.\n\n## What that makes non-production worth\n\nPut the two together and the priority inverts. Production optimisation is\nconstrained work — you are trading against latency, availability and blast\nradius, and every change needs a change window and a rollback plan. A\nnon-production environment that nobody is using has no such constraint. Turning\nit off at 7pm costs a developer nothing, because the developer went home.\n\nThis is the part that gets missed when FinOps is framed as rightsizing. The\nlargest uncontested pool of cloud waste in a regulated estate is not\nover-provisioned production instances. It is the second, third and fourth copy\nof production, idle, overnight, every night, in an account nobody reads the bill\nfor.\n\n## Where claims beat schedules\n\nIf the savings are comparable, the argument has to be about coverage, and it is.\n\n- **Global teams.** One schedule window is right for one time zone. Every other\n  office is either paying for hours it does not use or filing tickets to get an\n  environment back.\n- **Sprints move.** Load sits on `dev` early in a sprint and `test` late in it.\n  A schedule that fits week one wastes money in week two, and nobody re-tunes it.\n- **Exceptions eat the value.** The moment a team needs an environment outside\n  the window, someone builds on-demand start automation anyway — at which point\n  you have paid for the claim mechanism and are still running the schedule.\n- **Out-of-band starts leak.** Something started by hand at 2am is invisible to\n  a scheduler that only knows how to stop things on a cron. f1n treats that as a\n  first-class signal: detect the start, convert it into a bounded **SystemClaim**\n  with a policy TTL, or escalate it if it cannot be mapped to a known\n  environment.\n\nThe insight that falls out of that list is the design: if you need on-demand\nstart automation regardless, the cost-optimal default is an always-off schedule\nplus policy-aware on-demand access. Which is a claim."

What is not speculative is the\npattern — I built a version of it twice, at REPAY and then at First Citizens\nBank, and f1n is the generalised form of the thing that worked both times plus\nthe parts that did not.\n\n## What shipped at REPAY\n\nGreen-field AWS, a platform team growing from one engineer to eighteen, and a\nnon-production estate that grew faster than the team watching it. Environments\nwere given a lifecycle instead of an uptime: teams asked for one, got it for a\nbounded window, and the platform took it back without anyone having to remember.\nThe reusable-pattern work that cut cloud migration time from months to a day is\nthe same substrate — environments described once, so they can be stood up and\ntaken down as a unit rather than as a pile of individual resources.\n\n## What shipped at First Citizens Bank\n\nSame pattern, a very different shape of organisation: 100+ AWS accounts, a\nlanding zone, and compliance tiers that could not simply be switched off because\nsomeone thought they looked idle. Non-production lifecycle control was part of\nhow AWS spend came down 30% year over year alongside the FinOps dashboards and\nrightsizing automation. The harder half was never the start/stop mechanism. It\nwas answering \"which resources actually constitute the `uat` environment for\nthis team\" in an estate where two teams never modelled it the same way.\n\n## What the second build taught the design\n\nDoing it twice in two differently-shaped orgs is what turned a script into an\narchitecture, and three specific frustrations became structure:\n\n- **Inventory resolution is the hard problem, so it is a port.** Both orgs\n  needed environment-to-resource mapping and neither could use the other's\n  answer. `InventoryResolver` is an interface with a strategy registry and\n  fallback priority precisely because a single hardcoded discovery assumption is\n  what makes this class of tool undeployable in the next org.\n- **Anything you do not detect, you do not control.** Manual starts were the\n  quiet leak both times. Detection and system-claim conversion is in the design\n  from the start rather than bolted on after the first surprise invoice.\n- **A tool that only says no gets switched off.** Policy simulation, reason\n  codes on every denial, and staged rollout modes exist because compliant\n  behaviour has to be faster than working around it, and because a platform team\n  that cannot explain a denial spends its week explaining denials.\n\n## Where it stands\n\nThe design is complete and locked: eleven accepted decision records, a canonical\nvocabulary, a claim/lease state machine, hexagonal ports for providers,\ninventory and activation signals, and a first spec covering claim lifecycle and\nlease management. It is being built as a kit inside my platform-engineering\nmonorepo, where it governs that platform's own ephemeral environments — vCluster\npreviews, CI capacity, dev environments — so the first production user is me.\n\nNothing above describes running code except the two implementations that\npredate it."

Granting one\ncreates a **lease**, which is the persisted lifecycle contract and the single\nsource of truth about what should be running. Leases expire on their own; a\nrelease ends one early. Neither destroys anything — the vocabulary deliberately\nsays *shutdown* and *scale down*, never *destroy*, because a tool that can lose\na developer's work will not be trusted with the estate.\n\n## Claims nobody has to file\n\nScheduled claims cover the predictable case — a load test on Thursday — and\ncarry an acceptance window: if nobody confirms by the deadline, the claim\nauto-cancels rather than silently starting an estate for a test that got\ndropped. Where policy allows, a new claim can supersede or extend an existing\nlease without an operator in the middle.\n\nThe case I care most about is the one nobody files. When a resource starts\noutside f1n — a console click, a pipeline nobody registered, a 2am\ninvestigation — an activation signal is normalised from polling, a cloud event\nstream or a webhook, and turned into a **SystemClaim** bounded by a policy TTL.\nIf the signal cannot be mapped to a known environment it escalates instead of\nbeing dropped. A control plane that only governs the traffic it initiates is\ngoverning the wrong set.\n\n## Drift is assumed, not hoped against\n\nDesired state and provider state diverge — an API call fails, someone stops\nsomething by hand, an autoscaler disagrees. Reconciliation is mandatory rather\nthan a feature: detect the mismatch, remediate it, and escalate explicitly when\nit cannot be remediated. Unresolved drift ends in `manual_review`, which is a\nterminal-safe place for a human, not a retry loop.\n\n## Explaining itself is a requirement\n\nTwo primitives exist purely so people trust the thing.\n\n**Policy simulation** runs the real policy path with no side effects, so a\ndomain admin can see what a change would have done before it does it, and a\ndeveloper can find out why a claim will be denied before filing it.\n\n**Reason codes** are stable, machine-readable identifiers attached to every\ndenial, cancellation and forced action. They surface to the user and to\ntelemetry at once — which means \"what is our top deny reason this month\" is a\ndashboard query, and DX friction becomes a measurable quantity instead of a\ncomplaint in a retro.\n\nSavings are reported the same way: estimated from tags and metadata, then\nreconciled against billing data, with a what-if estimator that returns a range,\na confidence level and its assumptions — and whose predictions are compared\nagainst realised outcomes so the estimator's own error is tracked.

          "kind": "custom",
          "body": "## The ledger is a file in the repo, not a marketing page\n\nThe kit carries an anti-pattern ledger. Every entry has the same four parts: the failure mode, why it bites, the practice the kit enforces instead, and the packages that implement it — plus an honest status of **shipped**, **partial**, or **roadmap**. The rule that keeps it worth reading is in its own opening paragraph: a practices document that overclaims is itself the anti-pattern. Every package claim in it was checked against source before it was written down.\n\nMost of these are not textbook. They are in the ledger because they happened — to this kit, or to something it was extracted from — and the entry exists because a primitive was added afterwards to make the mistake structurally hard to repeat. Fifteen entries so far.\n\n## Context and memory — where agentic systems rot quietly\n\n**Severing the evidence link to save tokens.** Context fills up, the workload compacts, old turns become a model-written summary, and the originals are discarded. Nothing announces that the system now knows less than it did an hour ago. This is the canonical failure the kit exists to prevent, and the opinion is one sentence: a summary is a *projection over* ground truth, never a replacement. Compaction may shrink what the model sees; it must never shrink what the system knows.\n\nThe mechanism has three parts. Windowing returns an API-valid suffix plus the count of what was dropped, and it will not split a tool call from its result — a window that produces an illegal transcript is not a smaller context, it is a 400 with extra steps. A compaction hook splices a role-safe summary at the cut point. And the compactor that ships for that hook journals every dropped message verbatim *before* it calls a model at all, stamps the template version and prompt hash into the summary as a structured marker, and returns a failure rather than a lossy fallback when the summarizing model errors. The guarantee is preservation and provenance. The package states outright that the *fidelity* of the summary is the model's problem, not the kit's — that disclaimer is marked as one that must be kept visible.\n\n**Memory poisoning.** Untrusted content flows into a persisted store — a vector index, a conversation summary, a retrieved chunk — and re-emerges later as trusted context. The attack is temporal: the injection and the exfiltration happen in different turns, and by then the model cannot distinguish \"the user told me this\" from \"a web page I fetched three turns ago told me this, and I summarized it into working memory.\"\n\nWhat ships: untrusted payloads are fenced between per-wrap unguessable delimiters before they touch any store or summary path; tool results are screened before they re-enter the conversation; and evidence provenance stamps survive compaction, so a retrieved claim still carries whether it came from a primary source or from a prior tool result. What is **not** built, stated in the same entry: a provenance-aware retrieval gate that refuses to re-inject evidence below a grade threshold, and a store-layer policy that rejects fenced untrusted content from entering long-term memory without an explicit declassification step. The anti-pattern is mitigated at the edges and not closed end to end. That entry is marked partial for exactly that reason.\n\n## Claims — where agents lie\n\n**Unsourced assertions and broken evidence links.** The agent asserts; nobody can say where the claim came from, who produced it, or how much of it to believe. Fabricated references pass because nothing checks whether a reference resolves.\n\nThe opinion is evidence before assertion, and it is enforced by refusing to store the alternative. The atomic evidence unit carries an epistemic grade, an author — human, or AI with a full reproduction key — and a click-traceable source locator; validation refuses to accept anything without provenance *as evidence*. Confidence is capped by tier — doc-claimed and SME-stated share one ceiling on purpose, because both are unverified hearsay and the platform refuses confidence 3-of-5 to anything not at least pre-scanned. The ceiling is a deterministic function over the tier, in the scoring package, rather than a sentence in a prompt the model could talk its way past. The honest limit, which the fathom page states from the other side: the cap is opt-in. A caller has to apply it, nothing enforces it at a write path yet, and the design that turns it on structurally so no caller can forget is adopted and unbuilt. On top of that sit two deterministic checks with no model in the loop: one that flags unresolvable or fabricated references, and one that returns allowed / hedge / block on overclaiming. Same input, same verdict, every time — which is the only way a gate is auditable.\n\n**Eval loops that lie.** The subtler version: the thing you built to measure quality is itself unfalsifiable. The evaluation runner in the kit is written against five specific lies, and refuses each by construction rather than by convention — a judge grading its own model family, a verdict that never reached a journal, a budget silently blown mid-run, a \"stable\" result nobody probed for variance, and a run over an empty corpus exiting green. Independence is validated at construction for every judge-lane-and-producer pair, and a violation is fatal; the only way an all-one-family configuration builds at all is to declare the run non-decisive up front, after which no record may be marked decisive. A budget denial mid-run writes error records for every remaining pair instead of truncating silently. An empty bank is a typed refusal, not a pass.\n\nAnd the runner's own doc states the limit as plainly as the guarantees: it proves independence, journaling, budget enforcement and probe wiring. It never proves judge *correctness* — position bias, verbosity bias and style bias all survive family separation.\n\n## Control flow — where agents run away\n\n**Improvised escalation.** \"Try the cheap model, and if it feels wrong, hack in a retry with the big one.\" Escalation accretes as ad-hoc control flow: unauditable, untestable, different in every workload. The kit's answer is that escalation paths are declared data. Model escalation is a ladder of rungs climbed only on an explicit signal carrying an audit reason, and the rung injects its model into the request — which is what lets a ladder compose with any client rather than being welded to one. Refinement loops are bounded by a round count and then flagged as escalated rather than looping. Termination is a value, not an exception.\n\nOne detail carries most of the weight: a model asking to use a tool is a **success**, never an escalation trigger. Treating it as a failure is the single most common way a first agent loop ends up retrying its way through a budget. Escalate on measured quality, not on a stop reason you did not expect. Relatedly, the stop-reason set is treated as open — the kit knows four and treats anything else as \"stopped for a reason this build does not recognise\" rather than falling through a switch.\n\n**Unbounded loops and spend.** An agent loop with no turn cap, calls with no budget, caches and seen-sets that grow forever. The failure mode is a bill or an out-of-memory, discovered afterwards. The rule is charge before the money leaves: the harness charges the budget guard before *every* model call and ends the run with a budget stop on denial. The public-endpoint gauntlet applies the same rule one level down — even its cheap topic-judge call is charged before the judge fires, so a refused charge means the judge never runs. Every cache, queue, seen-set and buffer on the request path has an explicit bound and a stated behavior *at* the bound; append-only ground-truth stores are deliberately unbounded, and that consequence has its own ledger entry rather than being ignored.\n\nThe honest part of that entry is what makes it credible. One per-identity limiter map had an eviction routine that nothing ever called, so it grew for the life of the process. The audit found it; the sidecar now sweeps on a timer; and the entry says plainly that anyone embedding the guard directly has to schedule that sweep themselves, because the kit cannot own a ticker without taking on a runtime dependency. It is written up as the one structure on the hot path that needed explicit wiring instead of being self-bounding.\n\n## Inputs — where agents get owned\n\n**Trusting tool and model output.** Tool results flow back into the conversation unexamined, fetched content is pasted next to instructions, and \"we run it in a subprocess\" gets mistaken for containment. The harness screens every tool result before it re-enters the conversation. A flagged result is *replaced* by an error result naming the detection, so the raw payload provably never enters the transcript; annotating instead is available and is not the default, because detection is pattern-based and best-effort and the default should assume the detector is imperfect. Bounded subprocess execution is labeled resource confinement and explicitly not a sandbox, in its own package documentation, with the list of what remains unrestricted spelled out.\n\n**The lethal trifecta.** A tool that reads untrusted content, a tool that reads private data, and a tool that writes externally. None is dangerous alone; together, one injected payload can read secrets and exfiltrate them inside a single turn with no human checkpoint. The kit's answer is a capability taxonomy declared at *registration*: each tool declares which of the three it exercises, and an absent declaration is treated as **unknown, not clean** — under the strict mode an undeclared tool is assumed to do all three. When the registered toolset's union would complete the trifecta, the registration of the completing tool fails closed with a typed error, before a single token is spent. Overriding requires a named authorizer and a written reason; a bare boolean cannot do it, because provenance is the point of the override.\n\nTwo deliberate choices sit inside that. Enforcement is at registration and not at dispatch, because the trifecta is a property of the assembled toolset rather than of any one call — and registration is the cheapest possible seam. And the taxonomy is self-declared, which the docs state as a limitation in the same breath as the capability: a tool that lies about itself defeats the check entirely. The value is making a *truthfully declared* risk auditable and forcing an explicit, named authorization — not immunity.\n\n**Tool poisoning.** A remote tool server's descriptions are fetched over the network and injected into the agent's context on every listing. Whoever can change those descriptions can hide instructions in what looks like metadata, and the model will read them as instructions. The mechanism: hash each tool's identity, description and input shape at first listing, store the pin, and re-verify on every subsequent listing — because a listing is the only path by which a description enters the model's context. A changed description returns a typed error rather than silently forwarding modified instructions, and rebinding takes an explicit repin call, so drift is visible and auditable instead of absorbed.\n\nThe limits are written down next to it, not below the fold. Call-time does not re-verify the pin — drift between a listing and a call is caught at the *next* listing, and a pre-call check is recorded as an open hardening item whose decision belongs to the owner. And pinning defends against drift after first contact, not against a poisoned introduction: whoever controls the very first listing is trusted from then on.\n\n## Surfaces — where definitions drift\n\n**Tool definition sprawl.** The same tool defined three times — once for the model request, once for the dispatch switch, once for the external listing — and the three diverge on a Tuesday. Define it once. One registration feeds the model request, the loop's dispatch, and the external tool listing. Policy checks, per-tool timeouts and panic recovery are owned in that one place, so every failure mode — unknown tool, policy denial, handler error, panic, timeout, cancellation — reaches the model in-band as an error result rather than as an uncaught Go error or a dead process. Foreign tools bridged in from other servers land in the same table, so all of that governance applies to third-party tools without special-casing.\n\n**Schema and doc drift.** The docs describe one shape, the code another, the stored data a third, and the drift is discovered by an outage rather than by a gate. The contract language owns shape, Go owns behavior, and the gate turns drift into a test failure: contracts are vetted along with their example fixtures, the package catalog is generated from doc comments rather than hand-maintained, and a lint pass turns eleven constitutional promises into build failures — including that the package count printed in the README matches the count derived from source, that every package is classified in the stability table, that every exported identifier has a doc comment, and that no organization-specific token or secret-shaped string exists anywhere in the tree.\n\nWhat that gate cannot catch is a hand-written status paragraph going stale, and that is exactly where the last drift showed up: a status line in the ledger describing a capability as not-yet-built after the implementation had shipped and been checked into the tracking ledger. Mechanical checks catch mechanical drift. Prose still needs a reader.\n\n## Process — where the discipline dies\n\n**Live-API-only testing.** If the only way to exercise the agent is against the real API, it is slow, flaky, expensive and unrunnable in CI — so it stops being run. The ladder is deterministic below the top rung. A scripted double that *rejects requests a live client would refuse*, so a test cannot pass a request the real API would 400. Record/replay cassettes with request-hash matching, so prompt or schema drift fails loudly instead of quietly replaying an answer to a question you no longer ask. An exported conformance suite that any new client implementation must pass, so a second provider adapter cannot quietly mean something different. And exactly one paid rung, gated on a key and skipped cleanly without one — never part of the gate.\n\n**Invisible runs.** The agent ran; nobody can say what it did, what it cost, or which model call belonged to which run. One canonical event shape, one run identity minted by the loop and adopted from context when one exists, so loop events and model-call events join. Instrumentation emits exactly one event per *logical* call, with retry sitting innermost and attempts surfacing as an attribute — so dashboards keep a stable shape during a retry storm, which is precisely when you are looking at them. Cost accounting ships **no price table**, on the grounds that a stale embedded price is worse than none.\n\n**Governance as the thing you remember to add later.** The scaffolder that generates a new consumer project emits the governed composition by default; the bare loop is behind an explicit minimal flag. Defaults are policy. If the fast path is ungoverned, the fast path is what ships.\n\n**Kits nobody consumes.** The sprawl anti-pattern the kit measured on itself: a composition layer with no real consumer is a demo with a package name. The response was to make the label public — any kit still at zero consumers is marked composition-unproven in its own documentation — and to order the build queue by pull, so no new zero-consumer package lands while a consumer-proven ask with a hand-rolled implementation is still open.\n\n## What the ledger refuses to say\n\nEvery entry ends with a status, and three of the fifteen are partial rather than shipped. That is the part that makes the other twelve usable. A ledger where everything is green is a ledger nobody checked."

          "body": "## The insight this is built on\n\nTwo agents writing paragraphs can contradict each other completely and nothing in the system knows. The contradiction is real, it is load-bearing, and it is invisible — because prose has no join key. Nothing can be compared, so nothing can disagree, so no question is ever raised.\n\nTwo agents writing *typed, graded, provenanced* assertions against the same subject anchor produce something a machine can notice. The disagreement becomes a value with a kind and a severity. \"Should a human look at this?\" stops being a judgment call somebody has to remember to make and becomes a query over the artifacts the run already produced.\n\nThat is the whole thesis. Human-in-the-loop is not a modal dialog bolted onto a pipeline. It is a property of the shapes the pipeline writes down.\n\n## The model proposes. It never writes.\n\nThe write path is the sharpest expression of it. In the human-in-the-loop engine, the model may only propose *typed operations* from a whitelist. The engine dry-runs a proposed operation against a clone of application state and produces a preview: a human-readable summary of what it would do, plus the before-and-after deltas on a set of named gauges — the numbers a reviewer actually cares about, moved.\n\nThe load-bearing invariant is that **the same applier function drives both the preview and the commit**. Preview runs it on a clone; apply runs it on live state. There is no serialization step, no re-parse, no second implementation of \"what this operation means\" — so there is no window in which what a human approved could diverge from what lands. The end-to-end scenario asserts this directly: the preview summary references the same value the commit actually wrote.\n\nThe whitelist is the second half of the same idea. The set of allowed operation kinds is a single value that feeds **both** the enumeration the model sees in its tool schema **and** the guard the engine consults. The allowed set and the schema the model is shown cannot drift, because they are the same list. A disallowed operation fails at the guard on both paths — preview and apply — before it can reach the applier at all. And a rejected or invalid operation previews *with its reason*, so the interface can explain why it cannot be applied rather than offering an approve button that will fail.\n\nThe engine is deliberately transport- and storage-agnostic. The consuming application parses tool calls into operations, owns the approval endpoint, and owns the lock and persistence around the commit. That is a stated boundary rather than a gap — but it means the kit makes no promise about anyone's approval UI, and says so.\n\nThis composition is proven, not asserted: a seeded end-to-end blueprint wires document extraction, the governed agent loop and this engine together, with the model side fully scripted so it runs with no API key. Its tests assert that the budget was charged once per turn, that the journal recorded the run, that the preview matched the commit, that untouched fields stayed untouched, and that two identical runs produce identical reports under the race detector.\n\n## What surfaces the right question at the right moment\n\nAsking a human is cheap. Asking a human *the right question, about a specific thing, at the moment it is answerable* is the hard part, and every mechanism below exists to produce that.\n\n**Conflict detection over graded claims.** A conflict taxonomy operates on assertions and evidence spans that carry a grade, an author and a declarant — deliberately separate from the older, impoverished graph type that performs no tier-aware reasoning. It emits typed conflict kinds with a deterministic severity, computed so the *stronger* side dominates: a documentary source contradicting anything scores high regardless of what it contradicts, while two weak sources disagreeing scores low. That ordering is what makes a review queue meaningful rather than alphabetical.\n\nThe detail I care most about is what it does when it finds nothing. A conflict detector's worst outcome is a silent false negative — zero conflicts because the two sides were keyed in different namespaces and never joined at all. So the result carries join statistics, and a degenerate zero-join over non-empty inputs is distinguishable from genuine agreement. The structure reports its own failure to work.\n\n**Confidence ceilings by tier.** Confidence is derived from evidence count and agreement, and the maximum a tier permits is a deterministic function over that tier — a number computed from data, not a sentence in a prompt. That is what makes \"the model sounded sure\" answerable rather than persuasive. The part I will not overstate: applying the cap is the caller's move. It is not enforced at any write path yet, and the design that turns it on structurally is adopted and not built — the fathom page says the same thing from the consuming side, where the ceiling function is called zero times.\n\n**A deterministic honesty verdict.** Allowed, hedge, or block, with no model in the loop. Same input, same verdict. A gate that is itself a model is a gate you cannot audit.\n\n**The escalation ladder.** Fast cache lookup, then exhaustive search, then a human. Its invariants are the interesting part: a cache hit is *signal only* and never a verdict; an empty cache is a miss, never a conclusion; and a timeout at the human tier fails closed to *unresolved*, never to *absent*. The difference between \"we did not find it\" and \"it is not there\" is exactly the difference a tired reviewer collapses at 6pm, and the type system refuses to collapse it.\n\nEvery escalation to a human writes a gap record to an append-only log. Projections over those records warm the fast tier for next time — so the human's answer becomes a *signal* that lowers the cost of the next search without ever being allowed to substitute for it. Warmed entries are documented as signal-only and are invalidated by any change under the concern's declared constraints. That is the flywheel: human attention is the scarcest input, so the system is built to spend less of it over time without ever pretending it spent none.\n\n**Typed concerns, not comments.** A concern flag carries a type, a severity, the specific target it applies to, and a written rationale. A flag names the node it is about, so the question put to a human is about one paragraph or one field — not about a document. The review queue orders by severity first and insertion order second, so the ordering is deterministic and two runs present the same work in the same sequence.\n\n**An event-sourced claim lifecycle.** Claims move through proposed, supported, refuted, uncertain and superseded as an append-only, hash-chained event log, with the current view derived by projection. Every event carries an author — a human, or an AI with its full reproduction key. So \"who changed their mind, when, and on the basis of what\" is a query, and a claim's history survives the loss of any projection.\n\n## Where this is honest about not being finished\n\nThe generic ask-and-answer elicitation primitive is labeled **composition unproven** in its own package documentation: no consumer has wired it into a workflow. The one real workload that needed elicitation built a domain-specific layer with typed card kinds, field validation, criticality ordering and a ledger-backed status machine — and the kit refuses to absorb that shape, because doing so would drag organization-specific types into a library whose whole premise is that it carries none. If a second consumer ever needs a generic version, that package is the natural home. Until then it is provisional and says so.\n\nThe escalation *interface* and its record types live in the foundations; the propose-preview-approve-commit wiring that satisfies it deliberately does not, because foundations may not import the composition layer. That is a layering rule, and the consequence — the consumer assembles the last mile — is documented at the seam rather than papered over.\n\nAnd the honest framing of the whole page: none of this makes a human *right*. It makes the question specific, the disagreement visible, the approved effect identical to the committed effect, and the answer attributable afterwards. Those are the four things that were missing."

          "body": "## Fail closed is a design law, not a setting\n\nThe rule is that gates err toward refusal, and the interesting part is how many separate places had to agree to it before it meant anything.\n\n**At startup.** The production sidecar refuses to boot on a missing or placeholder identity salt, on proof-of-work enabled without a long-enough secret, on an unnamed model, or on an unset credential environment variable — each with an error naming exactly what to set. A demo mode exists and skips those checks, which is precisely why it is a separate mode rather than a fallback. A system that degrades into demo mode when misconfigured is not fail-closed; it is fail-quiet.\n\n**At the edge of a request.** The body cap is applied before any JSON is decoded, so an oversized body gets a templated refusal and never reaches a parser, let alone a model. Server timeouts are set against slow-reader and slow-loris shapes. The same cap is enforced by the library itself, so a hand-wired deployment that skips the sidecar is still capped by default.\n\n**On the wire.** An oversized protocol message is answered with an explicit parse error and a resync to the next message boundary — and when a clean resync is impossible, the server fails closed rather than guess at where the next message starts. Ambiguous transport state is treated as a security condition, not a parsing inconvenience.\n\n**On egress.** The egress middleware passes every outbound text-bearing field through a caller-supplied transform before the client sees it, and any transform error aborts the call — the inner client is never invoked. Its documentation puts it bluntly: a gate that degrades to pass-through on error is not a gate. It also gates by *field* rather than by declared block type, so a mislabeled block cannot smuggle text past, and it deliberately does not string-transform structured payloads, because blindly rewriting JSON corrupts it and a token substituted inside a JSON string silently changes what a tool does.\n\n**On the answer path.** If the judge or the model errors or is unavailable, the answer is deny. Errors must never become a bypass.\n\n## Bounding spend before the money leaves\n\nThe economics of an internet-facing prompt are the whole problem: people ask it things it should not answer, bots hammer it, and the bill is the attack surface. The gauntlet in front of a paid call is ordered free-to-expensive and short-circuits at the first refusal, so a rejected request costs nothing in model spend.\n\nThe ordering choices are the design. Proof-of-work runs *before* the topic gate, because verifying one signature is cheaper than any embedding call — so a bot has to burn CPU before it can trigger even the cheap layer. The challenge itself is minted and signed server-side over the nonce, difficulty and expiry, so a client cannot forge one; verification authenticates the signature in constant time, enforces a difficulty floor and the expiry, *then* checks the work, *then* checks replay — so a forged challenge claiming zero difficulty and a far-future expiry is rejected outright, and failed attempts never consume a nonce. The replay set is bounded and fails closed: entries evict only once their challenge has expired, and at the cap with nothing evictable, verification is refused rather than weakened.\n\nThe primary bill cap is deliberately **not** per-identity blacklisting. Addresses rotate; blacklists lose. The thing that makes a bill un-blowuppable is an aggregate budget that trips on the first of request-rate, daily-request or daily-spend limits and then opens a breaker so *everyone* gets a polite refusal until cooldown. The per-identity strike ledger still exists, and it is genuinely useful for honest repeat offenders and for having an auditable record — but it is secondary, and the docs say so rather than selling it as the defense.\n\nTwo details show the rule being applied to itself. First, the only model spend a *rejected* request can cause — an ambiguous question escalating to a small judge — is charged to the budget before the judge fires, and a refused charge means the judge is never called and the breaker force-opens. The attacker does not decide how many refusals you pay for; the budget does. Second, the honest caveat sits in the same paragraph: embedding-similarity calls are still uncharged. They are an order of magnitude cheaper than a judge call, but they are not zero, and pretending otherwise would be the kind of rounding that turns into an incident.\n\nEvery outcome of the gauntlet is a labeled counter, so the refusal *mix* is observable — not just the total. And the whole policy layer compiles to WebAssembly, which means the same audited code can run in the pod or be pushed to an edge worker to reject cheap junk before it reaches the origin. The boundary is stated: a browser-side check is a local pre-check only and proves nothing to anyone, because only the server holds the signing secret.\n\n## Provenance you can verify without trusting the system that produced it\n\n**A hash-chained event store** is the system of record: each entry commits to its predecessor, so a chain can be verified offline without trusting any projection or secondary store. The threat model is written into the package doc rather than inferred — verification detects any edit by a party who cannot recompute the hash, and any reordering, middle-drop or sequence gap. It does **not** detect an authorized rewrite by a holder who recomputes the whole chain, nor tail truncation, because dropping the last few entries yields a valid shorter chain. Catching either requires anchoring the head hash and the entry count somewhere external. Naming the two attacks a hash chain does not stop is what makes the ones it does stop believable.\n\n**Anchoring** closes exactly that gap, and its privacy design is the reason it is a separate primitive. Content hashes are batched into a Merkle tree; the inclusion proof for one item reveals only the path of sibling hashes to the root, so a single item can be proven to have existed at anchor time without revealing anything about the others in the batch. Proof-of-time is explicitly *not* self-asserted — it relies on an external authority, and the submission to that authority is an adapter concern rather than something the kit pretends to be.\n\n**A reproduction key on every AI-authored artifact** — model, prompt hash, params hash, input digest — rides every span, decision and prose node, so a claim traces back to what produced it rather than to a commit range.\n\n**Evidence spans** carry grade, author and locator, and the validation step refuses to store as evidence anything without provenance. That refusal is the enforcement; nothing downstream has to remember to check.\n\n## The one deletion story, and what it does not cover\n\nAppend-only stores are append-only by design — replay requires an unbroken record — and the consequence is that personal data written into them cannot be removed. That was documented as a limitation before it was a capability, which is the right order.\n\nWhat ships now is crypto-erasure, and its scope is narrower than the phrase suggests. Values routed through the tokenization vault are encrypted under a per-namespace key; destroying that key makes the stored ciphertext permanently unrecoverable while the audit log of tokenize and detokenize actions — including the denied ones — stays intact. A separate, pure retention evaluator takes caller-supplied rules and an inventory and returns which namespaces are due for which action: shred, flag for human review, or report. The foundation decides; the caller executes. Adapters that claim to implement shreddable storage have to pass an importable conformance suite, so \"we implemented shred\" is a test result rather than a claim.\n\nThe limit is stated everywhere it matters: this covers only what was routed through tokenization *before* it was written. Anything that went straight into a journal, ledger, event store or cassette has no deletion path at all. The guidance to an adopter under a real erasure obligation is correspondingly blunt — route it through the vault before it touches anything append-only, because nothing else here can forget.\n\n## Governance applied to the kit itself\n\nThe same posture points inward. A lint pass inside the build gate turns eleven constitutional promises into build failures, and two of them are security controls in their own right: a whole-tree scan for well-known secret shapes, and a whole-tree scan for organization-specific tokens. Both read the on-disk tree rather than consulting version control, so a file that never got committed is still scanned. The secret scan carries a planted-positive canary test — a check that has never been proven to fire is not a check.\n\nThat is the through-line for this whole page. Fail-closed is not a configuration value someone can flip; budget enforcement is not a dashboard; and provenance is not a log appended at the end. Each one is a property of where the seam was cut, which is why they survive contact with a workload that did not read the documentation.\n\n*The threat model — what a malicious prompt or tool result can and cannot reach, and the explicit list of what is not guaranteed — has its own page.*"

These are the shipped mitigations, not a wish list.\n\n- **Prompt-injection screening.** Untrusted content is scanned against a data-driven rule set — callers supply the rules, nothing organization-specific is hard-coded — and when a detector is wired, every tool result is screened before it re-enters the conversation. Recall is 22 of 22 on the kit's own seeded corpus, and the same paragraph says that corpus is necessarily finite.\n- **Untrusted-content fencing.** External content is fenced between per-wrap unguessable delimiters, so a fake closing fence forged by the content itself carries the wrong value and stays inert data.\n- **Instruction precedence.** System above developer above user above untrusted, enforced in how the kit's own code treats content by tier.\n- **Redaction before the model.** Recognizable secret shapes are redacted before content reaches an LLM, and the redaction executor was fuzz-hardened to a true fixpoint after a real single-pass leak was found. One shared rule engine sits under all four scanners, so it is one audited engine rather than four independent ones.\n- **Deny-by-default tool execution.** Where a policy is wired, a tool with no policy match is denied, not permitted, and every dispatch failure surfaces in-band to the model rather than as an uncaught error.\n- **Lethal-trifecta blocking.** Tools declare whether they read untrusted content, read private data, or write externally. A missing declaration is treated as unknown, not clean. When the registered toolset would complete the trifecta, registration fails closed before a token is spent, and overriding requires a named authorizer and a reason.\n- **Tool-description pinning.** An MCP server's tool descriptions enter the model's context on every listing, so each is hashed at first listing and re-verified on every subsequent one. A changed description returns a typed error instead of silently forwarding a modified instruction; rebinding requires an explicit repin, so drift is visible and auditable.\n- **Audit trail.** An append-only, hash-chained event store; append-only claim and correction ledgers; and a reproduction key on every AI-authored artifact — model, prompt hash, params hash, input digest — so a claim traces back to what produced it. The MCP call log records metadata only unless payload logging is explicitly opted into, and then the log is treated as sensitive.\n\n## What is explicitly not guaranteed\n\nThe ceiling on every claim above is a single belief: no capability theater. Unpacked concretely:\n\n- Fencing and instruction precedence are defense-in-depth, not a security boundary. A sufficiently persuasive payload inside a fence can still influence what the model does; the fences make the attempt visible and consistently handleable, not impossible.\n- Bounded subprocess execution is resource confinement, not a sandbox. The child runs with the host's full ambient authority — filesystem, network, memory, CPU, privileges — bounded only in wall-clock time and captured output bytes. Real isolation needs OS primitives a stdlib-only kit deliberately does not provide.\n- Redaction is best-effort shape matching. Encoded secrets, secrets split across segments and novel formats pass straight through untouched.\n- Append-only stores have no general deletion story. The one exception is narrower than it sounds: values routed through the tokenization vault can be crypto-erased by destroying the per-namespace key, which covers only what went through that step. Anything written directly into a journal, ledger, event store or cassette has no deletion path at all.\n- The capability taxonomy is self-declared. A tool that lies about what it reads defeats the check entirely. The mechanism's value is making a truthfully declared risk auditable and forcing a named, provenance-bearing override — it cannot see a capability an author hid.\n- Description pinning defends against drift after first contact, not against a poisoned introduction. Whoever controls the very first listing is trusted from then on.\n- Trifecta detection runs once, at registration, for the whole toolset. That is a deliberate seam — the trifecta is a property of the assembled toolset, not of any single call — and it means a runtime capability change is not re-evaluated.\n\n## If you need more, you add it yourself\n\nThe document ends by telling an adopter what to build rather than pretending it is covered: put a real OS-level sandbox around anything whose blast radius matters; route regulated data through the vault *before* it touches anything append-only, so there is something to erase later; add the specific attack patterns and secret shapes your own threat model requires, because the shipped rules are a starting catalog and not a certification; audit or conservatively over-declare the capabilities of tools you do not control.\n\nThe same honesty applies to data handling in the ordinary case. Identity is a salted hash, so no raw address or personal data is stored — but the violation ledger is append-only by design, snapshots persist it across restarts, and there is no per-identity erasure. Deleting the state file is today's only eraser, and the doc says exactly that.\n\n## Why the limits are written down\n\nA limits list is not modesty. It is what makes the rest of the claims checkable. If the document that tells you recall is 22 of 22 on a named corpus also tells you the corpus is finite, you can calibrate — and if it did not, you could not trust the first number either.\n\nThat is the whole bet: in a foundation, overclaiming is a defect class equal to a failing test. This is the enforcement."

The fix is to make a prompt a *named, versioned template rendered against typed parameters*, and to make rendering emit three things alongside the text — a hash of the rendered prompt, the template version, and a hash of the parameters.\n\nThose three values map one-to-one onto the authorship record that rides every AI-produced evidence span, decision and prose node. That is the whole mechanism, and it is deliberately small: the reason it exists is that the authorship record had fields for a reproduction key and nothing in the tree could produce them. Now \"which prompt produced this paragraph, at which version, with which parameters\" is answerable from the artifact itself rather than from commit archaeology.\n\nTwo choices in that package are worth the space:\n\n- **A missing parameter is an error at render time, not an empty string in the prompt.** Rendering is strict about keys. That one decision removes a whole class of silent quality regressions — the kind where a template quietly renders a sentence fragment for a week and the output gets subtly worse in a way no test notices.\n- **There is deliberately no prompt registry.** Callers own storage and lookup. A registry is a storage decision, and the kit does not make storage decisions on behalf of consumers; the coupling to the provenance record is one-way and optional, so a consumer that never records provenance never touches it.\n\nThe compaction summarizer is the worked example of the whole pattern eating its own cooking: it ships its own versioned template, stamps the version into the summary marker it writes into the transcript, and its documentation instructs a maintainer to bump the version on any change that would alter model output.\n\nThe honest status: **drift is attributable today, not auto-detected.** The reproduction keys are shipped end to end. The regression harness that would catch quality drift is a separate thing — the evaluation runner — and it is classified experimental with a single self-hosted subscriber, because an evaluation harness with no corpus and no user is a demo. Knowing *which* prompt produced a bad answer is solved. Being told automatically that answers got worse is not.\n\n## Prose is a graph with provenance, not a blob of text\n\nGenerated prose in this kit is not a string that comes back from a model. It is a set of traceable nodes, and each node carries the evidence references that contributed to it, a redaction flag with a written reason when it has been redacted, and a marker for whether a correction has invalidated it.\n\nThe order of operations is the design:\n\n- **A plan before generation.** An ordered set of sections, each with a title and a stated authoring intent. Generation follows the plan; it does not discover a shape. Duplicate titles and empty intents are refused at validation, so the plan is a contract rather than a suggestion.\n- **Redaction before the model sees the request.** The request text is passed through the pre-model gate first, not after.\n- **Parsing into nodes, then citation.** Citations are rendered deterministically and — this is the part most systems skip — they can be *parsed back*. The round trip is the point: a citation that can only be printed is decoration, while one that can be read back and resolved is a link.\n- **Per-node policy evaluation, then typed concerns.** Each node is evaluated independently, and a violation raises a concern flag naming the specific node, its severity and the rationale.\n- **A publishability gate at the end.** Output is not publishable because it reads well. It is publishable because a weighted gate passed and the flag set is empty.\n- **Regeneration as an append-only log.** A correction carries an identifier and the set of nodes it invalidates; the regeneration log records the chain, so a paragraph that changed can be traced to the correction that changed it and the unaffected nodes are provably untouched.\n\nThe same discipline shows up on the assembly side. Context assembly is deterministic and budget-bounded: segments carry a priority, and the lowest priority truncates first. Which segment got dropped is a property of the data, not of whichever code path happened to run that day.\n\n## Audience — two different things, deliberately kept apart\n\nMost systems conflate \"who is this for\" as *tone* with \"who is this for\" as *permission*. The kit separates them, and is explicit about which one is enforced.\n\n**Audience as intent is an input, and only an input.** The section plan's intent field and the generation request's audience tier shape what the model is asked to produce, and the tier is surfaced on the generated nodes and carried into citations. Its own documentation calls it informational. It is not an enforcement mechanism, and treating it as one would be exactly the capability theater the kit treats as a defect class.\n\n**Audience as posture is a policy, and it is enforced.** What may appear for a given audience is decided against ordered posture levels — open, internal, restricted, secret — with caller-supplied rules naming which terms activate at which threshold. Nothing organization-specific is hard-coded; an organization adds a rule by writing validated data.\n\nThe boundary between those two packages is drawn on purpose and stated in the docs: **posture evaluation decides and never rewrites.** It returns whether a segment is allowed as-is and which terms must be redacted. Actually stripping the content is a different responsibility living on the security side — a pre-model gate that redacts recognizable secret shapes, and an executor that applies a compiled policy to a fixpoint, proven idempotent under repeated application after a real single-pass leak was found and fuzz-tested against. Deciding and executing are different jobs, and fusing them is how a redaction policy becomes untestable.\n\nThat separation generalizes past prose. The egress middleware is the same idea at the client boundary: one transform, applied to every outbound text field, in one place, instead of remembering to do it at every call site. It gates by field rather than by declared block type so a mislabeled block cannot slip through, refuses rather than passing through on error, and deliberately leaves structured payloads alone because blindly rewriting JSON corrupts it — a redaction label inserted mid-document breaks parsing, and a token substituted inside a JSON string silently changes what a tool does.\n\nAnd the limit, stated as plainly as the capability: shape-based redaction is best-effort. Encoded secrets, secrets split across fields and novel formats pass straight through. The rules are caller data precisely so a workload can add what its own threat model requires — the shipped set is a starting catalog, not a certification.\n\n## What audience shaping is today, and what it is not\n\nToday, audience shaping in the kit is **policy plus intent**: a posture that governs what may appear, and an intent that governs what the model is asked for. There is also a typed card generator that shapes extracted document content according to a declared archetype — a governed, field-by-field projection rather than free prose — which is the closest shipped thing to \"one source, several shaped outputs.\"\n\nWhat does **not** exist is a renderer that takes one governed artifact and projects it into several audience-specific versions with their postures applied per version and the citations rewritten to match. The pieces are deliberately positioned for it — the nodes carry their evidence references and redaction provenance, the posture levels are ordered, the citation renderer round-trips, and the regeneration log is append-only. **The design intent is that a per-audience projection becomes a pure function over that graph.** It is direction, not something running, and it will land the way everything else in this kit lands: when a real workload names itself the subscriber and shapes it against real requirements."

          "body": "## Five tiers, and imports only point down\n\nThe tree is 190 Go packages in one module whose `go.mod` has no `require` block — zero external Go dependencies. The layering is a rule, not a description:\n\n- **foundations** — narrow, stdlib-only packages: the durable nouns. Evidence, provenance, governance, security, telemetry, cost, retrieval, review, prose, the LLM client.\n- **kits** — high-order workflows composed from foundations: the agent harness, the MCP server, the endpoint guard, investigation, human-in-the-loop.\n- **runtimes** — policy enforcement and credential-resolution substrates.\n- **surfaces** — human- and developer-facing interfaces, including a schema-driven form engine and its editor layer.\n- **toolchains** — the canonical CUE schemas, generators, and materialization.\n\nFoundations import only the standard library and sibling foundations. Kits compose foundations. Nothing imports upward from a kit back into a foundation. All five tiers are ordinary importable packages — the tier names a package's *role* in the layering, not its visibility.\n\nAnything organization-specific — sensitivity catalogs, redaction rules, taxonomies, provider tables — is validated CUE data, never hard-coded Go. That is what makes the kit org-agnostic in a way that survives contact with a second organization.\n\nOne more fact worth stating plainly, because it shaped every convention above: the kit is developed almost entirely by AI agents. The rules are strict because the authors are fast.\n\n## The loop is the product, and it is one call\n\nThe agent harness is a single `Run(ctx, input)`: model turn, then tool dispatch, then governance screens, repeat until a stop condition. Two dependencies are required — an LLM client and a tool registry. Everything else is a seam the caller injects: budget guard, injection detector, telemetry sink, run journal. A nil seam turns that feature off. Nothing is hard-wired into the loop.\n\nTwo properties matter more than the loop itself:\n\n- **Transcript invariants are structural.** Role alternation and exact tool-call/tool-result pairing are owned by the conversation primitive, so a malformed transcript is unrepresentable rather than \"validated\".\n- **Termination is a value, not an exception.** A run ends completed, max-turns, budget, refusal, max-tokens or canceled. A Go error means infrastructure failed — and the transcript is still returned with it.\n\nProvider stop reasons are treated as an open set: the kit knows four and treats anything else as \"stopped for a reason this build does not recognise\". Unknown provider content blocks are carried verbatim and echoed back untouched — which is why thinking-model blocks survive multi-turn round trips through a package that does not model them.\n\n## One tool table, two surfaces\n\nA tool is defined once — a definition plus a Go handler — and that single registration feeds the model request, the harness's dispatch, and an MCP server's tool listing. Policy checks, per-tool timeouts and panic recovery are owned in the registry, so every failure mode (unknown tool, policy denial, handler error or panic, timeout, cancellation) reaches the model in-band as an error result, never as an uncaught Go error or a crashed process.\n\nThe same registry is what foreign MCP tools are bridged into, so all existing governance applies to third-party tools without special-casing.\n\n## Governance sits inside the loop, not around it\n\n- The budget guard is charged **before** every model call. A denial ends the run with a budget stop, not an exception — and the charge is an honest pre-call estimate, paired with usage-based actuals from the cost middleware.\n- Tool results are screened before they re-enter the conversation. A flagged result is replaced by an error result, so the raw payload provably never enters the transcript. Blocking is the default because detection is pattern-based and best-effort.\n- Tools declare their capabilities at registration. When a toolset's declared capabilities would complete the lethal trifecta — reads untrusted content, reads private data, writes externally — registration fails closed before a single token is spent, and overriding requires a named authorizer and a stated reason. A bare boolean cannot bypass it.\n\n## A gauntlet in front of a public endpoint\n\nThe endpoint-guard kit orders its layers free to expensive and short-circuits at the first refusal, so a rejected request costs nothing in model spend: body cap, circuit breaker, hashed identity, strike ledger, rate limits, proof-of-work, topic gate, answer cache — and only then the paid call. The proof-of-work challenge is signed server-side, so clients cannot mint or tamper with one, and its replay seen-set is bounded and refuses rather than weakens when it fills.\n\nThe primary bill cap is deliberately not per-identity blocking — addresses rotate — it is a global budget that trips the breaker for everyone until cooldown. Even the topic gate's judge call is budget-charged before it fires, so a refused charge means no call at all. The honest caveat is in the same document: embedding-similarity calls are still uncharged, an order of magnitude cheaper than a judge call but not free.\n\nEverything lives inside one process: no external cache, no captcha vendor, no external rate limiter, with an optional local snapshot so a restart does not forget the blocklist and the budget.\n\n## The same policy at the edge\n\nEvery governance package is pure Go that compiles to WebAssembly, so the audited policy can run in the pod, at an edge worker, or in the browser. The shipped example puts the proof-of-work solver in the browser and a cheap prefilter at the edge. The boundary is stated rather than blurred: the browser-side check proves nothing to anyone else, because only the server holds the signing secret — server-side verification is authoritative.\n\n## Testing is a ladder; only the top rung costs money\n\nA scripted mock client where the tools genuinely execute, then committed replay cassettes matched by request hash so prompt or schema drift fails loudly instead of lying, then an exported conformance suite that any new client implementation must pass, then one live smoke test that skips cleanly without a key and is never part of the gate.\n\n## What the gate proves\n\nThe validation task is formatting, vet, contract validation over every schema *and its fixtures*, and race-detector tests across every package, plus the constitution lint that turns doctrine into build failures. Two-layer git hooks run the fast checks on commit and the whole gate on push. Tags are cut only at green gates — which is what makes a tag safe to build on."

          "kind": "design",
          "body": "## Zero external dependencies — and what it cost to keep\n\nThe root module has no require block. The reason is not aesthetic: a kit meant to be embedded in everything may depend on nothing, or it hands every consumer a potential dependency conflict and forfeits WebAssembly portability.\n\nThat promise was breached exactly once. Two document-format handlers needed third-party parsers, the require block grew, and four documents went on promising zero deps. The repair was to decide whether the rule was constitution or marketing — it was constitution — move the dependency-bearing handlers into nested modules, and make the rule mechanical so prose could never drift from reality again. The cost is stated rather than hidden: those nested modules carry their own tags and their own release cadence.\n\n## CUE owns the shape; Go owns the behavior\n\nEvery foundation ships a contract file next to the Go that mirrors it. CUE is a language where a type is a value and a value is a type, and the only operation is unification: merge two constraints, fail if they contradict. There is no inheritance and no last-writer-wins, only narrowing — which is exactly what a platform that prizes determinism wants. It buys four things Go structs alone cannot:\n\n- Constraints, not just field names: non-empty string, one of these five values, a list of at least one element, a number in a range.\n- Build-time validation, in a pre-commit hook, long before runtime.\n- Configuration as validated data — an organization adds a rule by writing data that must unify with the schema, so the platform stays general-purpose without hard-coding anyone's catalog.\n- Executable fixtures: positive examples the compiler checks, so a schema change that breaks a real example fails at commit time.\n\nDefinitions are closed, so a misspelled field is an error rather than a silently dropped value — the whole class of \"I set the config key and nothing happened\" bugs mostly disappears. And because CUE owns shape, a schema change *is* an API change: field removal, type narrowing or a newly required field is breaking even when no Go signature moves.\n\n## Determinism is the default; nondeterminism is injected\n\nClocks, randomness, network, subprocesses and model calls all live behind seams. Library code takes an injected clock function; a bare call to the system clock in library code is a defect, not a style preference. Tests are table-driven, sleep-free, network-free and race-clean. Anything that ran once must be replayable — cassettes for model calls, append-only journals and a hash-chained event store for state, golden tests for outputs.\n\nThe justification is operational, not ideological: a harness you cannot replay is a harness you cannot debug, regress or trust.\n\n## Fail closed, spend bounded\n\nGates err toward refusal. If a trust decision cannot be made — partition, schema mismatch, exhausted budget — the call does not execute. Every paid call is budgeted before it is made. Every cache, queue, seen-set, buffer and loop on the request path has an explicit bound and an explicit behavior at that bound, while the append-only ground-truth stores are deliberately unbounded because that is their job.\n\nWhere the rule was not actually true, it is written down rather than quietly patched: one per-identity limiter map had an eviction method that was never called, so the map grew for the life of the process. The fix, the wiring it required, and the fact that callers embedding the kit directly must schedule it themselves are all documented in the anti-pattern ledger.\n\n## Honest contracts: the non-guarantees are load-bearing\n\nNo capability theater. The untrusted-content wrapper is defense-in-depth, not a security boundary. Bounded subprocess execution is resource confinement, not a sandbox. Redaction is best-effort shape matching. Append-only stores have no deletion story. Overclaiming is treated as a defect class equal to a failing test, because it is how trust in a foundation dies.\n\nIn practice that reads as a discipline rather than a disclaimer. A detector's recall is quoted as a real number against a named seeded corpus, and the very next sentence says the corpus is finite. A capability taxonomy is called self-declared, and the doc says plainly that a tool which lies about itself defeats the check.\n\n## Capabilities land when a workload pulls for them\n\nSpeculative abstraction is junk even when it sounds visionary. Patterns that are obviously coming get written into a roadmap with a subscribe-when trigger and are deliberately *not* built; they graduate when a real workload names itself the subscriber and shapes them against real requirements. The build queue is pull-ordered — no new zero-consumer package lands while a consumer-proven ask with a hand-rolled implementation is still open — and extraction only counts as done when the donor deletes its copy.\n\nThe counterweight is recorded honestly: at the last audit, roughly half the library packages had no consumer anywhere. That measurement is why the rule exists.\n\n## The junk gate\n\nA change may land only with a contract where the shape is data, deterministic race-clean tests pinning its central claim, docs that state its non-guarantees as plainly as its guarantees, either a real consumer or a named future workload that pulls for it, and the full gate green. \"Looks done\" is the enemy — the most dangerous artifact in a foundation is a half-baked capability that demos well.\n\n## Stability is a classification, not a stamp\n\nEvery package under the five library roots is classified stable, experimental or internal-ish, with a written rationale for each — 124 stable at the sign-off snapshot, the rest flagged as still-moving or as narrow plumbing. Pre-1.0, stable packages may still break, but never silently: a migration note and a ledger update ship in the same commit. Exported sentinel values and typed error structs are part of that contract.\n\nThe audit that produced the table also produced an uncomfortable result and left it visible: a package classified experimental had picked up a live downstream consumer, which means that consumer has no compatibility promise. The row was not quietly upgraded to make the conflict go away — it was flagged for an explicit decision."

          "body": "## Where an agent's budget actually goes\n\nAn agent dropped into a large repository does not spend most of its tokens writing code. It spends them rediscovering facts the repository already knows: where a symbol is defined, who calls it, what a change will touch, which tests cover it, and — the expensive one — which rules govern the file it is about to edit.\n\nThe tool it reaches for is grep. Grep answers a text question with text. It has no notion of a caller, a callee, a package boundary, or a second repository. It cannot rank an answer by how it was established, cannot tell you the answer is out of date, and cannot tell you two sources disagree. A single \"where is this handled?\" therefore decomposes into a search plus four to six file reads — five to twenty thousand tokens — to answer a question the index answers in one hop at three hundred to eight hundred.\n\nThe baseline that started this project was measured, not assumed: a day of instrumented work in an indexed repository recorded 193 grep calls and zero index calls. Across a longer window, the share of discovery actions the agent chose to route through the index sat between zero and seven percent.\n\n## The second failure is worse than the token bill\n\nRediscovery is expensive. Editing against rules nobody told you about is wrong.\n\nEvery team hand-maintains agent-instruction files, standards, decision records and plans that describe what the code is obliged to do. Those documents rot silently. They are never scoped — the agent sees all of them or none of them — never cited, and never expire. A paragraph that stopped being true six months ago reads exactly like a paragraph that is still binding.\n\nAnd the checkbox at the end of the task is a claim, not a fact. Every shipped spec-driven-development tool lets the agent self-report \"done\"; none of them checks that claim against a code index. A plan can be fully ticked and half true.\n\n## What changes when the agent has a map\n\nThree things change, and they are different in kind.\n\n**Discovery gets cheap and structural.** Every query names a concern; the engine filters observations to that concern, ranks them, and truncates. That scoping alone measured roughly a 77% token reduction against dumping a service's whole symbol list. One neighbourhood call returns a definition with its direct callers, its direct callees and its related tests. \"Who, anywhere in the fleet, calls this?\" becomes a single query across repository boundaries — something the harness has no native capability for at all.\n\n**Answers carry their own epistemics.** Every record is stamped with an evidence tier, so a fact extracted from code outranks a claim made in a document, and no amount of documentation raises the ceiling. Every response carries a staleness assessment — which sources, how old, and whether re-ingest is recommended. Symbol lookup is tiered and says which tier matched, and a miss returns suggestions instead of an empty result. Two records asserting incompatible things about the same symbol are surfaced as a contradiction rather than resolved by luck.\n\n**\"Done\" becomes checkable.** A plan task claimed complete is verified against the index — the symbol exists, a test statically reaches it, no contradiction stands — with file-and-line citations, at push time and in CI. The gate caught three over-claims by its own author on its first run.\n\n## The part that got measured, and did not go as planned\n\nThe original pitch was that index-first discovery would cost about a tenth of a grep-and-read sweep. A benchmark was built specifically to falsify that, with the failure criterion registered in advance. It fired. Fifteen real tasks, two agent arms: equal success on both, 1.38× aggregate token reduction, 2.81× mean wall-time reduction. Real, and nowhere near the claim. The ×10 form of the sentence was retracted in every document that had made it.\n\nA second benchmark ran on the engine's own home turf — index-native tasks it should win most easily. It did not win decisively either: equal success, a slight token premium. That result was written down too.\n\nOnly after the causal fixes those benches identified — a bounded raw-text read on the agent surface, real line extents on document sections, and a set of payload corrections — did a re-run of the same unchanged criteria pass: 13 of 13 successes against 11 of 13, at 0.570× the tokens and about a third fewer turns. The lookup benchmark improved to a 1.96× reduction, still under the pre-registered bar, so the ×10 retraction stands. The honest pitch is: strictly better answers at roughly half the tokens, two to three times faster, plus governed capabilities no grep loop has and which neither bench measured.\n\n## The finding that reshaped the product\n\nThe most consequential measurement was not about tokens at all. Across a week of real production traffic — 7,466 tool calls — the tools the agent *chose* to call accounted for about 1.7%. The single most-called tool was the daemon's own identity lookup, which is hook plumbing.\n\nThe conclusion drawn was not \"push harder on the tools.\" It was that a tool an agent may choose to call is a zero-moat position, because the harness owns default policy. Delivery became **configuration, not agent habit**, with channels ranked by force: a blocking gate beats injected context beats a pulled tool call beats passive documentation.\n\nIn that same production week the forced half measured 91% injection coverage — 4,106 edits seen, 3,753 answered, 1,966 carrying a governing rule — at a median 130 ms and a 95th percentile of 1.54 s, with the verification gate catching 57 failing rows. The pulled half stayed at ~2%. The record calls that split a product truth, not a measurement artifact."

          "body": "## Stage one: bytes to evidence\n\nA connector abstracts where source comes from — a local tree, a hosted repository through its CLI, or a deterministic fixture corpus — behind two operations, discover and fetch. Nothing downstream knows which one it is talking to.\n\nThe fusion pipeline runs three passes. Filter is sequential and drops vendored trees, generated files and anything the ignore rules exclude. Fetch is parallel into pre-allocated slots; the first error is taken by an atomic compare-and-swap and workers drain rather than being cancelled mid-flight. Post-fetch is sequential again, deliberately re-imposing the original input order so that a parallel fetch still produces a deterministic result.\n\nIn that third pass each file is fingerprinted, compared against its stored hash, and skipped if unchanged; a changed file has its stale records purged first; the run aborts cleanly if pending bytes would exceed the configured budget. The target is stated as a number rather than an adjective: re-ingesting a fifteen-thousand-file repository where fourteen-nine hundred files are unchanged must be near-free — hash compares only.\n\nExtraction is per-language and unsentimental about it. Go goes through the standard library's own parser, because the standard parser is strictly better than a generic grammar for Go and there is no reason to pay a runtime cost for a worse answer. Configuration and infrastructure formats — infrastructure-as-code, cluster manifests, schema definitions, module manifests, Markdown — get their own native parsers rather than being force-fitted into a code grammar. Everything else runs on tree-sitter: newer languages on a pure-Go WebAssembly runtime, admitted one language at a time only after clearing a calibration corpus against the incumbent; nine older ones still on native bindings, which are now the only reason the full binary needs a C toolchain at all. The store itself needs none.\n\nA later correction pass made the index honest about what it was reading: one registry as the single source of language identity, dispatch by a content-and-path classifier that recognizes what a file actually is rather than what its extension suggests, and an additive typed-edge pass that resolves ambiguous method calls into edges that carry a kind — direct, interface dispatch as an edge set, or unresolved — without mutating the syntax-derived contract underneath.\n\n## The atomic record\n\nEverything extracted lands as an **observation**: the service it belongs to, the concern it is scoped to, an anchor of file and line, what kind of thing it is, the evidence tier that produced it, the symbol, a human-readable statement of the fact, a content hash, its outbound call edges and its complexity. That record is the unit the whole system trades in — one shape for a Go function, a Python class, a cluster workload, a schema definition or a document section.\n\nEvidence tiers are inherited from the governed-evidence platform this engine is built on, not invented here: extracted-from-code, pattern-matched, stated-in-a-document, said-by-a-human, inferred — each with a confidence ceiling. A code fact never outranks a document claim by accident, because the ordering is in the data.\n\n## Stage two: the query model\n\nEvery query names a **concern**. The engine filters to that concern, scores by keyword or blended semantic overlap, and truncates to a top-N. Forcing the caller to be specific is treated as the point rather than a cost: it is what keeps results relevant and what produced the measured token reduction.\n\nOn top of that sit the shapes an agent actually needs: symbol resolution that tries exact, then case-insensitive, then substring and reports which tier matched; a symbol's neighbourhood — definition, direct callers, direct callees, related tests — in one call; bidirectional call trees at bounded depth; blast radius and test impact for a proposed change; the same questions asked across repository boundaries; a budget-bounded context pack that reports what it dropped to fit; and a bounded, line-numbered raw read for the case where the agent genuinely needs the current text at a cited line.\n\nThree properties make those answers different from search results. Every result carries a staleness assessment, because silent staleness is a correctness trap for a machine consumer. Incompatible claims about the same symbol surface as contradiction pairs. And every response that could mislead carries its markers — tier, staleness flag, how the match was made, the corpus watermark it was answered from.\n\nThe query layer never touches a network. Reasoning happens when a layer compiles; a query is a deterministic join.\n\n## Stage three: compiling what governs the code\n\nA whole class of knowledge is invisible to a scraper, because producing it requires reasoning rather than parsing: what a file is obliged to do, why it is shaped this way, what a prior review already found here. That is the second stratum, and it is compiled, not retrieved.\n\nThree sentences discipline it. *Meaning is compiled* — a layer is a build target over a corpus, incremental by input digest, budgeted with an estimate before and real usage after, and versioned so that prompt plus model plus inputs give a reproducible identity. *Reasoning at compile time, determinism at query time.* *A claim is only as good as its anchors* — every claim cites the source lines it restates and the code scope it governs, and a claim whose citations or scopes do not resolve is rejected at compile time rather than served hopefully. That last rule is not fastidiousness: the surveyed base rate for citation errors in frontier models is 15–20%, so compile-time anchor verification is mandatory or the whole stratum is untrustworthy.\n\nClaims live in additive tables beside observations, never inside them, because re-ingest purges observations destructively and the contradiction scan is blind to record kind — a claim stored there would be destroyed by a routine re-ingest or false-positived against a function signature. Claim identity is content-addressed; a superseded claim is status-flipped, never deleted, because audit history is cheap now and unrecoverable later.\n\nFreshness runs on two mechanisms because they cover different windows: a token-free sweep after every ingest that re-hashes each claim's cited lines, and a status check at query time. A drifted citation whose original text now resolves to exactly one new location is re-anchored automatically with an audit entry; zero matches or several fall through to stale. A stale claim is served **flagged** — never silently served, never silently dropped, because an agent that saw a rule yesterday should see \"that rule is stale\" today, not absence.\n\nA layer ships as a pack of data — a validated manifest, a content-addressed prompt, corpus selectors, labelled evaluation fixtures with deliberate scope traps, and a kill gate — never as Go code. Four packs ship in the binary today: per-file obligations, architectural constraints from decision records, plan-task bindings, and review findings. A project adds its own by installing a directory. The admission bar is precision at or above 0.90 and recall at or above 0.75 against its own fixtures, scored against a real model, with the run recorded. Two of the shipped packs scored 1.00 on both. One — the findings pack — has not cleared its gate; the first real run aborted before scoring on an unrelated defect, the failure was filed rather than glossed, and the tier promotion that depends on it stays switched off.\n\n## Stage four: delivery, ranked by force\n\nThe engine ships three surfaces — an importable client, a command-line binary, and an MCP server over stdio or a loopback HTTP daemon with path-scoped surfaces per audience. Every capability is a scriptable verb first; a surface-only capability is treated as a defect.\n\nThe load-bearing decision is the admission that surfaces are not enough. Channels are ranked: **blocking gate**, then **injected context**, then **pulled tool call**, then **passive documentation**.\n\n- At **session start**, an index status and operating primer, about eighty tokens.\n- **After every edit**, the obligations governing the edited file, capped at roughly 150 tokens, with zero output when there is nothing to say — injection is affordable precisely because silence is free.\n- **Before** an edit to a scope the project has explicitly declared guarded, the same payload arrives ahead of the tool call, with the author's own one-line note first. Non-matching files cost one local pattern test and no daemon call at all. This channel injects and never blocks; an edit-time denial would train agents to route around it.\n- At **session end**, tasks claimed complete this session that fail verification are surfaced — advisory by default, blocking by opt-in.\n- At **push and in CI**, the gate. It fails *open* on operational error and *closed* on evidence: a claimed task that failed verification blocks the push; an unreachable daemon warns loudly and lets it through, because a gate that blocks a push over a dead background service punishes the wrong behaviour. CI fails closed on both, because CI owns determinism and builds its own index.\n- The **pull surface** remains, curated to sixteen tools for the agent path with the full registry one endpoint away. An off-surface call still executes and is flagged in the log rather than rejected, because a rejection teaches abandonment, which looks identical to no-demand in the data.\n\n## What it costs\n\nCompilation reads slow-churn governing documents, so a full compile of a repository is single-digit cents, a code commit costs nothing to recompile — claims join to code by scope at query time rather than being recompiled against it — and a documentation edit costs pennies through per-section digest gating. Spend is ledgered per run from real provider-reported usage, not heuristics, and a dry-run estimate is mandatory before any spending path. Six provider lanes are supported, two of them drawing on an existing subscription rather than a metered key; an unrecognized lane is a typed configuration error listing all six, never a silent fallback. Government-cloud deployments are profiles over the existing cloud lanes — a region, an endpoint, a deployment name — not modes and not a separate code path, and the configuration doc says so in those words.\n\nCosts scale with change size, never repository size. That is a structural property of where the claims are anchored, not an aspiration."

The reason is written down in the decision record: *\"A sextant navigates by surface sightings; a fathom measures depth. The product's differentiation is no longer only navigation (where is the symbol) but governed depth (what governs this file, why, and how sure are we).\"* The rename landed in the same change as the semantic-layers design, so the name and the architecture say the same thing. The old name survives only in historical records — changelog entries, journals, dogfood notes — because those describe past events.\n\nIt also bit back, which is recorded rather than tidied away: the rename left one repository's directory name pointing at a service that no longer existed, and rule injection was silently dead there for six days while probe traffic looked healthy. The fix made the daemon's own repository-to-service mapping authoritative instead of guessing from a directory name, and the incident became the evidence for a standing rule that every measurement channel ships with an \"is anything flowing?\" assertion.\n\n## Three layers, strictly separated\n\nThe founding decision is a boundary, not a feature. A **connector interface** abstracts the source: discover, then fetch. A **fusion pipeline** turns source references into bytes, then into evidence observations in the store. A **knowledge query layer** turns the store into typed results per query or tool call. The stated reason is short: *\"Each layer is independently testable and replaceable. The query layer never touches a network; the pipeline never knows where bytes came from.\"*\n\nThree connectors exist: local disk, a hosted forge through its CLI, and a deterministic fixture connector over invented, org-neutral test data. That last one is not an afterthought — the record calls it *\"the backbone of the TDD strategy\"*, because the entire fusion and query stack is exercised against fixed fixture data with no network and no credentials.\n\nThe pipeline runs three passes: sequential filter, parallel fetch into pre-allocated slots with the first error taken by an atomic compare-and-swap, then a sequential post-fetch that deliberately re-imposes input order so a parallel fetch still yields a deterministic result. That third pass fingerprints each file, skips it if unchanged, purges its stale records if changed, and aborts the run if pending bytes would exceed a configured budget. The target is a number: *\"Re-ingesting a 15k-file repo where 14.9k files are unchanged must be near-free (hash compares only).\"*\n\nExtraction is per-language and unsentimental. Go goes through the standard library's own parser — *\"Go AST is strictly better than tree-sitter for Go code, so no WASM/CGO cost is paid there.\"* Other languages go through tree-sitter, newer ones on a pure-Go WebAssembly runtime and nine older ones still on native bindings, each language admitted only after it clears a calibration corpus. Infrastructure and configuration formats use their own native parsers rather than being force-fitted into a code grammar.\n\nEvery query names a **concern**. The engine filters to it, scores by keyword or semantic overlap, and truncates. Every result carries a staleness assessment, and the engine surfaces contradiction pairs — two records asserting incompatible things about the same symbol.\n\n## Two strata: what the code is, and what governs it\n\nThe knowledge model is explicitly two strata. The **deterministic index** is scraped: symbols, call edges, routes, spec references, complexity — cheap, incremental, provable. **Semantic layers** are reasoned: compiled claims over governing documents, carrying citations, evidence tiers and staleness.\n\nThree sentences discipline the second stratum. *Meaning is compiled* — a layer is a build target over a corpus, not a retrieval pipeline: incremental by input digest, budgeted with an estimate before and real usage after, and versioned so prompt plus model plus inputs give a reproducible identity. *Reasoning at compile time, determinism at query time.* *A claim is only as good as its anchors* — every claim cites the source lines it restates and the code scope it governs; broken citations flag the claim rather than silently serving it.\n\nClaims deliberately do **not** live in the observations table. Re-ingest purges observations destructively, and the contradiction scan is blind to record kind — so a claim stored there would be destroyed by a routine re-ingest, or false-positived against a function signature. Same store, separate tables, same query engine on top. Claim identity is content-addressed; a superseded claim is status-flipped rather than deleted, because *\"audit history is cheap now and unrecoverable later.\"*\n\nFreshness uses two mechanisms because they cover different windows: a token-free sweep after every ingest that re-hashes each claim's cited lines and flips its status, and a status check at query time. When a citation drifts but its original text resolves to exactly one new location, the sweep re-anchors it and appends an audit entry; zero or several matches still fall through to stale. A stale claim is served **flagged** — never silently served, never silently dropped, because *\"an agent that saw a rule yesterday should see 'that rule is stale' today, not absence.\"*\n\n## The store is the module\n\nPortability is a birth property of the schema, not a later feature. Connectors emit root-relative anchors; the store never records a machine-local absolute path. Moving or shipping a corpus is one metadata update. Freshness is domain-neutral: the connector interface returns a repository head when one exists and a content-addressed manifest hash otherwise, so a non-code corpus — a standards folder, a findings export — can still say whether it is stale.\n\nThe contract is a named test rather than a paragraph: build a store on one corpus, move the corpus, remap the root, and check that symbols answer, citations resolve, the watermark reads fresh rather than falsely drifted, and re-ingest is fully hash-gated. *\"That test is the publishable meaning of 'portable store'.\"*\n\nThat is what makes an **expert module** a configuration rather than a second product: one store file containing the deterministic index, the compiled claims and their links, its own audit trail — a per-run compile ledger and an append-only claim-event log — and its own identity in the form of corpus root, watermark and layer versions. *\"The store file is the product; the binary is its reference reader.\"* What distinguishes it from a chatbot with a folder of documents is that every answer carries why it should be trusted, when it stopped being sure, and what it was compiled from.\n\nThat format is now written down as a normative spec rather than a phrase in a roadmap: a file container, two native format-identity markers, required tables per conformance level, anchor rules, watermark semantics, a closed evidence-tier vocabulary and claim-lineage rules including refutation durability. Every requirement carries either a named test or an explicit unenforced marker — including one test that diffs the spec's own required-schema table against the live schema, so the document cannot drift from the binary that implements it without something failing. The honest gaps are written into the spec itself, notably that the reference implementation has no read-only open path yet.\n\n## Federation, internally\n\nOn top of that spec sits a **module host**: the same daemon mounting several conforming store files read-only, as one surface. Not a new binary and not a second engine — the multi-store query path is built on the cross-repository graph machinery that already generalized over several services' stores. A store that is not conforming, or is conforming below the level the host requires, is refused loudly at mount rather than silently degraded. Every federated answer carries the identity of the module it came from alongside the tier and staleness a single store already had to carry, and a federated answer can never read fresher than its least-fresh contributing module.\n\nThe binding half is consumer-side and explicit: a repository opts in to a module through a committed, reviewable declaration, optionally narrowing which paths it applies to and what minimum tier it will accept. Central mounting makes a module *available*; only the repository's own binding makes it *apply*. Bound module rules then ride the same injected channel the repository's own rules do, module-tagged, with repository rules keeping priority within the payload cap and displacement counted separately for each.\n\nThe entry condition for external federation — real outside consumers targeting the format — is unmet, at zero, and is not claimed otherwise anywhere in the record. The host was built internally, deliberately and on the record, as the thing that could *generate* that evidence rather than as a claim that it had arrived.\n\n## Surfaces, channels, and instruments\n\nThree surfaces ship: an importable client, a command-line binary, and an MCP server over stdio or a loopback daemon with path-scoped surfaces per audience. Every capability is a scriptable verb first; a surface-only capability is treated as a defect.\n\nDelivery is **configuration, not agent habit**, with channels ranked by force: **blocking gate** > **injected context** > **pulled tool call** > **passive docs**. A gate at push and in CI refuses a task claimed done that the index cannot prove. Hooks inject at session start, before an edit to an explicitly guarded scope, after every edit, and at session end. The pull surface remains as the secondary path, curated to sixteen tools for the agent registration with off-surface calls executed and flagged rather than refused.\n\nMeasurement is part of the architecture rather than a report bolted on. Every tool call is logged with its tool, service, surface, latency, error and — after a deliberate repair — its **origin**, so gate and hook plumbing is separable from genuine agent tool-picking. Every channel emits a beat, so coverage has a denominator: injections divided by edits actually seen. Payload sizes are recorded at emit time, so the cost side of the ledger is real. Daily rollups, a set of metrics verbs covering spend, traffic, channel health, interventions and time series, and a status endpoint read from that same data. The discipline attached to all of it is that an absent instrument prints a named reason, never a zero.\n\n## What it refuses to be\n\nThe standing non-goal list is part of the architecture: no domain connectors, no web-scale code search, no editor language services, no embeddings-first chat, no multi-tenant hosting. No tool joins a surface without call-log justification. Every layer ships with its consumer, its evaluation fixtures and a kill gate. And costs scale with change size, never repository size."

          "body": "## The constraint that shaped everything: it has to be believable\n\nThis is a system whose entire product is being trusted about code. So the design is organised less around capability than around the ways a system like it dies. The design record names them explicitly, from the external survey: embeddings-first context engines get retracted; freshness kills compiled knowledge, and nobody attaches per-artifact staleness to it; coverage-first ontologies die before delivering anything; knowledge with no consuming tool stalls; and even citation-bearing frontier models mis-cite at a 15–20% rate, so compile-time anchor verification is mandatory rather than optional.\n\nThe conclusion is narrow, and stated as a correction of emphasis rather than a boast: the differentiator is not *having* compiled knowledge — everyone will have that. It is **governance**: provenance tiers on every answer, machine-checked contradiction against the deterministic index, honest per-claim staleness, costed compilation, and telemetry-gated existence.\n\n## Fourteen laws, written down and applied\n\nThe doctrine is a numbered list that later designs cite by number. The ones that bite hardest:\n\n- **Determinism first.** Validated rules and pure analyzers wherever possible; a model only at the semantic margin, always evaluation-gated.\n- **Never silent.** Cited refusals beat confident fabrication — including \"empty config reads as clean.\"\n- **Consolidate, don't grow.** No net tool growth; every addition rides a forced channel. Two tools have been added to the curated agent surface since it was founded, each with measured evidence for the addition rather than a hunch.\n- **Minimal theater.** Every move carries a kill criterion, or an explicit done-when-stamped terminal state.\n- **Activation is stamped, never prose-documented.** One feature sat inert for fourteen days and the flip date was never recorded, which destroyed the ability to distinguish no-demand from no-connection. Operator-run activation now writes a stamp the moment it happens, and plans reference stamps, not memory.\n- **Instruments get existence checks.** An adoption metric whose traffic source can silently vanish is theater.\n- **Kill clocks require a consumer population.** Zero-call evidence gathered while the intended consumers were deliberately paused proves exposure-zero, not demand-zero. Until qualifying traffic exists, a tool is *held as unmeasured*, never killed.\n- **Verb-first surfaces.** Every capability is a scriptable command before it is a screen; screens render state and dispatch verbs.\n- **The advisor recommends; the gate decides.** Agentic judgement is served with tier and citation and can never promote a readiness level. Promotion is deterministic criteria only — *\"the trust boundary that keeps 'agentic advising' from becoming vibes with a progress bar.\"*\n- **No saving is claimed without a counterfactual.** A token number is a *cost* until something establishes what would have happened otherwise.\n- **User scope may add defaults; only project scope may govern.** A machine-level file may contribute additive defaults and the operator's own notes; it may never narrow, weaken or widen committed governance — and every contribution is disclosed at the point of use, because *\"an undisclosed global is indistinguishable from a bug.\"*\n- **Confidence is capped by verification depth, not by assertion.** No quantity of documents or model output raises a ceiling; compilation cannot manufacture confidence, and re-running the same prompt on the same corpus is not corroboration.\n\n## Retraction as a design practice\n\nThe most unusual thing in these documents is how much of them is a record of the author disproving his own claims.\n\nThe original pitch was that index-first discovery would cost roughly a tenth of the tokens of a grep-and-read sweep. A benchmark was built with its failure criterion registered in advance. It measured equal task success on both arms at 1.38× aggregate token reduction and 2.81× mean wall-time reduction — real, and nowhere near the claim. The criterion fired, and the ×10 form of the sentence was **retracted in every document that made it**, replaced by a standing bar of equal-or-better task success at measurably lower tokens and wall time.\n\nA second benchmark then ran on the system's own home turf — the index-native tasks it should win most easily. It did not win decisively: equal success, a slight token premium. That was written down too, with the surviving pitch stated as \"equal answers, cheaper on some tasks, faster overall, with governance itself unmeasured by this bench.\" Only after causal fixes did a re-run of the same unchanged criteria pass, at strictly better success and roughly half the tokens — and the corpus revision for that re-run was committed *before* the run, as the registration proof.\n\nThe same discipline applies to instruments. A metric with no reachable signal prints a named reason, never a zero. Fields that can be absent are paired with a note that is always populated, so a present value with an empty note is a real measurement and a missing value always carries its reason. A shareable evidence bundle was audited, found to emit all-zero groups for instruments it had never actually read — indistinguishable from measured zero coverage — and restructured so an unread instrument is structurally absent rather than falsely zero.\n\nAnd when asked for a \"how many times did it save you from a mistake\" counter, the answer in the design record is a refusal: that number cannot be produced honestly, because it requires knowing what the agent *would* have done. What shipped instead is an interventions table counting only mechanism-verifiable events, each labelled by its mechanism — unproven \"done\" claims refused by the gate, findings raised then reconciled, non-conforming artifacts refused, governed edits with rules delivered, guarded edits pre-warned. *\"'Rules delivered' is a fact about fathom; 'mistake prevented' is a claim about the agent. We report the first.\"*\n\nThe same rule now governs the token story. A production week can say what governance *cost* per edit, because payload sizes are recorded at emit time. It cannot say what governance *saved*, because nothing establishes the counterfactual. The A/B protocol that would establish it is pre-registered in the design record — the protocol exists as text; the experiment has not been run — and the kill criterion attached to it is blunt: if the experiment shows the channels on being no better than off, every production savings claim gets retracted wherever it appears.\n\n## Staleness has four classes, each with an owner\n\nStaleness is treated as the way the whole design dies, so every class of drift gets a detector, a remediation and an honest surface: the index lagging commits, handled by an auto-refresh on head drift; the index lagging uncommitted local edits, handled by a per-file content hash at edit time with the payload saying so; the running binary lagging the code; and compiled claims lagging their corpus, handled by the post-ingest citation sweep plus a query-time status check. Then there is the meta-class the program was bitten by directly — instrument staleness, where an adoption script silently measured nothing after a rename — which is why every measurement channel now ships with an existence check.\n\nAn honest example of the machinery working against its author: a fleet-wide re-sweep against a read-only copy of the live store checked 340 claims, found 73 whose citations were wrong, and healed exactly zero of them — because every one of those claims predated the change that stores the cited text alongside its hash, so they can go stale but can never re-anchor until the next recompile. That degradation is written down as expected honesty, not a regression, along with the operator-visible consequence: dozens of rules that used to serve unflagged will start serving flagged, because the sweep is finally telling the truth about citations that were already wrong.\n\n## Honest failure beats eager enforcement\n\nA forced channel that lies or blocks for infrastructure reasons *\"gets uninstalled within a week\"* — treated as a design constraint, not a risk. So hooks never block on infrastructure; a down daemon degrades to an honest one-line notice or to silence, never an error and never a stall. The push gate fails **open** on operational error and **closed** on evidence. CI fails closed on both, because CI owns determinism and builds its own index. Pre-edit guidance is inject-only even though the hook mechanism could deny the call, because *\"an edit-time deny would train agents to route around the channel.\"* Intercepting the agent's most reflexive actions was rejected outright, with named revival evidence recorded in case telemetry ever justifies a hint — never a block.\n\n## Restraint as a recorded decision\n\nSeveral decisions are records of *not* building something, which is the harder thing to write down.\n\nA four-stratum taxonomy for pluggable content was adopted as **vocabulary layered onto mechanisms that already exist** — total implementation cost, one additive defaulted schema field — on the reasoning that two existing packs had already sat evaluation-perfect with zero production claims for weeks: *\"a pack library, or a fourth pack type, built ahead of a named consumer is theater, not progress.\"*\n\nTwo separate reuse opportunities from the sibling platform were read in full and then declined in writing, each with the forgone engineering named as accepted debt rather than quietly dropped. The reasoning in one is worth the whole exercise: adopting the shared kit would still have required building the surface, group, prompt and resource layer on top of it, so *\"adoption relocates work rather than removing it.\"*\n\nAnd every deferred piece of machinery — a generic layer runtime, a claim-lifecycle state machine, persisted vectors, a new evidence tier for compiled claims — is deferred **with named revival evidence**: the specific observation that would justify building it. Nothing is rejected; things are held until something makes them true.\n\n## The gap the design is currently pointing at\n\nThe confidence ceilings are documented in the domain model and enforced nowhere: the ceiling function exists in the shared platform and this engine calls it zero times. The review that found it did not soften it — it named it as the program's recurring failure mode, machinery built and never switched on. The design that turns the cap on structurally, at the write path rather than by caller discipline, is adopted and is where this is going next; it is a switch-on with an entry condition of none, and until it lands the ceilings remain documentation rather than enforcement. Writing that down is the point: a cap that is documented but unenforced is the defect being fixed, not a feature being announced.\n\n## What would falsify this\n\nThe design record ends with its own falsification conditions, kept deliberately. If the portability round-trip cannot hold without breaking existing queries, the \"store is the module\" commitment needs a migration story before anything external ships. If a compiled layer fails its precision gate on the author's own corpus, no external module is credible and the layer program stops at deterministic claims. And if serving claims from a non-code corpus demands engine special cases, the corpus-agnostic commitment was wrong and must be redesigned — which is exactly why a real non-code corpus was put in the first scope, to force that answer early."

          "kind": "custom",
          "body": "## Read this section differently from the others\n\nEverything on the other pages describes behaviour that exists. This page is the opposite: it is the direction, and every item on it is labelled as such. Nothing here is running. Where a thing is partly built, the line between the built part and the intended part is drawn explicitly, because the whole product is an argument about not overstating what is known.\n\nThe floor it builds on, in one paragraph and in the present tense: the index, the query layer, the claims stratum with its compile-time verification and its post-ingest sweep, the four semantic-layer packs, the forced channels — session brief, post-edit injection, guarded pre-edit injection, the push and CI gate, the session-end check — the curated agent surface, the instrumentation with origin tagging and per-channel beats, the read-only module host over conforming store files, the module authoring verbs with a machine-checked readiness ladder, and the two format specs with their falsifiability tests. That is what the direction below extends.\n\n## The unit of product is the module, and the next work is making one authorable\n\nThe engine already treats a store file as a self-contained artifact: index, claims, links, audit trail and identity in one file, with a spec that says what conformance means and tests that keep the spec from drifting from the binary. The command-line half of authoring one — declare, attach sources, map the deterministic gaps, compile, evaluate, get a verdict against a four-rung readiness ladder, package — exists today.\n\n**The direction is to make that path reachable by someone who will never read a spec.** The design commissions an interactive studio over exactly those verbs, then a server-rendered web rendering of the same state machine, on a rule written into the doctrine to keep it honest: every capability is a scriptable verb first, and the surfaces render state and dispatch verbs rather than owning logic. Neither surface is built. The exit criterion for the first one is deliberately embarrassing to fake — a scripted cold run has to go from a folder of sources to a servable verdict in one sitting, with every promotion criterion machine-checked; the second one is entry-gated on the first, because the state machine has to exist before it gets a second renderer.\n\n**The gap advisor is designed and not built, and its trust boundary is designed first.** The intent is a model pass that reads a module's declared scope and its corpus map and proposes what the module claims to cover but has nothing to say about — every proposal cited to what was actually searched, tiered, and killable by the same evaluation discipline as any other layer. The rule it is built under is already law: the advisor recommends, the gate decides. Agentic judgement can never promote a module's readiness level; promotion stays deterministic criteria only.\n\n## The flywheel the design is built toward\n\nThe sharpest idea in the program is not built yet and is worth stating as an intention rather than a capability: **consumption failures are the authoring backlog.** Every refusal, every stale-citation serve, every low-tier answer is a structured record of what was asked, what was searched, and why it failed. The design captures those locally and consent-first and surfaces them beside the deterministic gaps, so the author sees \"this many questions died in this scope this month,\" fixes sources, recompiles, and watches the same question answer with a fresh citation.\n\nThat loop is what would make authoring and consumption one product instead of two. Today it is a design with an evaluation gate attached to it and no code behind it.\n\n## Governed chat, and what it must owe the reader\n\nThe direction for consumption is a chat experience over the module host — with the contract written before the implementation, which is the part worth reading. The intended contract is that retrieval happens through the host, every claim in an answer must carry its citation with tier and staleness, and zero retrieved evidence must produce a refusal rather than an answer from the model's prior. The response type is meant to make an uncited sentence a type error rather than a runtime check.\n\nThe refusal is treated as a product surface rather than an error state: here is what was searched, here is why it cannot be answered, here is the one action that would fix it — which is what feeds the flywheel above. None of that is running. The answer loop belongs in the sibling governed-agent platform rather than here, so that this engine stays a substrate and does not grow a chat protocol of its own; any MCP-speaking client is meant to be a frontend to the same surface.\n\nHosting is gated on a law written before any hosting exists: **a hosted surface ships read-only before it ships writable.** Authentication and read-only enforcement are launch requirements rather than later hardening — not a thirty-day clock, a precondition. The reference implementation's own honest gap is written into the spec: there is no genuinely read-only open path today, because opening a store always runs its schema setup. Closing that is a prerequisite, and it is named as one.\n\n## Turning on the cap that is already documented\n\nThe evidence-tier ceilings are documented in the domain model and enforced nowhere — the ceiling function lives in the shared platform and this engine calls it zero times. The adopted design turns it on structurally at the write path, so no future caller can forget it, and sharpens it in two ways that are the interesting part.\n\nFactual claims get ceilings by verification depth: executed evidence above type-resolved evidence above parsed evidence above pattern matches above what a document asserts. Normative claims — obligations, decisions, standards — get a different ladder, because no execution proves an *ought*; their evidence is that an authority wrote them down, and the top rung has a precise meaning that is not \"a document says so twice\": a normative claim reaches it only when **a machine check enforces the rule**. That is design intent. None of it is wired yet, and the record says so in the same sentence that proposes it.\n\n## Making the token claim answerable\n\nThe cost side is instrumented: payload sizes are recorded at emit time, a session ledger joins them, and the report says what governance spent per edit. The savings side is deliberately blank, because the law says a token number is a cost until something establishes what would have happened otherwise.\n\nThe experiment that would establish it is pre-registered as text and has not been run. Its kill criterion is already written: if the channels-on arm shows no better than the channels-off arm after enough sessions, every production savings claim gets retracted wherever it appears. That is where the tokenomics story goes next — not to a bigger number, to an answerable question.\n\n## Extraction and distribution\n\nTwo mechanical directions, both with named triggers rather than dates. Cross-file caller resolution currently has real depth in one language; extending it to the languages an outside adopter would actually bring is demand-driven rather than scheduled, and the record already corrected an over-claim in its own documentation on exactly this point. And the binary still needs a C toolchain, now solely because nine language extractors ride native bindings; the store no longer does, and proved it by building and passing race-enabled tests with the C toolchain disabled. Moving those nine onto the pure-Go engine is what makes cross-compiled single-binary releases possible, and it is a separate slice whose trigger has not fired.\n\n## The bar for the whole thing\n\nExternal adoption is at zero and is not claimed otherwise. The entry condition for federation as an external story — real outside consumers targeting the published format — is written down, unmet, and repeated in every document that touches it. The module host was built internally as a deliberate schedule override, recorded as an override rather than as evidence that the condition had fired, on the reasoning that dogfooding it is how the condition could ever be reached.\n\nThe direction ends where the product's own doctrine points: the platform event is a third party building a module and serving it to their own consumers without the author in the loop. Everything above exists to make that event boring. Until it happens, the honest description is a substrate with a proven forced-delivery loop, a measured benchmark win on its own turf, a documented format, and a queue of designs whose entry conditions are written down before the code is."

          "body": "## The invariant everything else hangs off\n\nEvery kit app is one Go `http.Handler` tree, served by a real listener bound to loopback on a port the OS picks. Shells — a desktop window, a browser tab, a cloud deployment — are chrome pointed at that URL. No app code may depend on shell-specific bindings, IPC or events.\n\nThat is not an aesthetic preference. The obvious alternative, serving the app through a webview's request-interception layer, fails on dated upstream facts: on Windows the webview accumulates an entire response before delivering it, so a long-lived event stream never emits a single event; Android's interception drops `fetch()` POST bodies; the asset server rejects WebSocket upgrades outright; and progressive delivery over custom schemes on macOS is undocumented behavior that happens to work. Three of four targets break the transport the UI is built on. Working today by accident is not a foundation.\n\nThe loopback listener is what is left when you take the platform facts seriously, and it pays for itself: web, desktop and cloud become literally one binary, and swapping the shell is a chrome change rather than a rewrite.\n\n### Boot order is part of the contract\n\n- The listener is bound and serving **before** any shell exists, so \"the shell navigated to a dead port\" is not a failure mode that can occur.\n- Binding an ephemeral port makes port conflicts structurally impossible — the OS picks a free one and reports it back.\n- A single-instance lock forwards a second launch, with its arguments and any deep link, into the live instance and exits. A stale lock is detected by probing it, not by trusting it.\n- In browser-tab mode nothing owns the process lifetime, so the kit counts open streams: zero streams starts a grace timer, any new stream cancels it, and the timer firing is a clean shutdown rather than a zombie server on a random port.\n\n### The render loop\n\nThe backend owns all state. The DOM is a projection, never a store. A command is a short POST that mutates server state and returns almost nothing; the domain write lands in the event spine; the per-tab stream's watch fires; the page re-renders as one idempotent snapshot; the client morphs the DOM against it. Signals hold only ephemeral client interaction — a form draft in flight, an open menu, a highlighted row.\n\nThere is no optimistic UI. On loopback the round trip is sub-millisecond, and showing anything but server truth would be a latency hack for latency that does not exist.\n\nThe payoff is that reconnection, multi-tab convergence and long-running job progress are not features anyone builds. They fall out of idempotent snapshots plus one watch.\n\n### Three data homes, one rule\n\n- Durable relational truth is single-file SQLite through a cgo-free driver, with ordered, forward-only embedded migrations and a pre-upgrade snapshot instead of down migrations.\n- Reactive state is an in-process key-value bucket on the embedded spine, whose watchers are what drive re-renders.\n- Bulk analytical artifacts are columnar files, regenerable from source.\n- The rule of thumb is stated once and cited everywhere: if losing it would hurt, the relational store; if a restart may rebuild it, the key-value bucket; if it is columnar bulk for tools to chew on, the artifact layer. A datum never lives in two stores, and derived copies declare their source and get rebuilt rather than edited.\n\n### Shells answer honestly\n\nApp code never imports a shell. It asks the kit for a capability — windows, dialogs, tray, notifications, clipboard, secrets, file scopes, deep links, updates, power events — and gets one of three answers: supported, degraded, or absent. Getters never return nil, so app code never nil-checks; it checks the level only when behavior actually depends on it.\n\nThe app manifest declares which capabilities are required and which are optional, and boot fails fast — with the relevant matrix row in the error — when a required one is absent on the current shell. Because the matrix is itself typed data, \"does this app run in the cloud tier?\" can be answered without booting anything.\n\n### Contracts before code\n\nEvery schema is authored once, in CUE, in a subset that collapses to concrete Go types. One generator emits Go type declarations, a design-token bundle in the W3C interchange format, and the theme CSS the styling binary consumes. Generated output is committed and CI fails on any diff, so a clean checkout builds without running the schema toolchain at all. At runtime the evaluator is embedded and the app validates its own manifest and config at startup.\n\nThe two layers are deliberate. Generated types can only ever be **too loose**, never wrong, and the runtime check catches what the types do not — which is what makes depending on an experimental type generator survivable.\n\n### The knowledge surface\n\nThe third pillar is a single MCP binary that makes the kit's own knowledge queryable from inside whatever project an agent is working in: component search over an index compiled ahead of time and shipped inside the binary, pattern guidance, design tokens, project audits, and the decision corpus served as both tools and stable resource URIs.\n\nIt owns no pipeline — it is a query head over artifacts built earlier. Semantic ranking is an enhancement, never a dependency: when no local embedding service is reachable, search degrades to keyword plus structural filters and says so in the response rather than failing.\n\n### Why failures are boring\n\nBecause the app is a real HTTP server rendering idempotent snapshots, most failure modes collapse into the same recovery: reconnect and re-render. A crashed webview relaunches at a fresh URL and the snapshot repaints exactly where the user was. A suspended laptop reconnects on the client's built-in retry. A missing webview runtime falls back to a browser tab in the same process, because \"no chrome\" must never mean \"no app\". The recovery story is the architecture, not bolted-on code."

          "body": "## Two languages, and no third\n\nAll logic is Go. All schemas are CUE. Nothing else is a source language in the kit or in any app built on it. JavaScript never enters as source and is never built by a toolchain — it arrives only as vendored, version-pinned, embedded artifacts that record upstream version, source URL and checksum alongside the file. CSS comes from a standalone binary pinned by SHA-256 per platform and verified on every run, where a mismatch is a hard build failure rather than a warning. A package manifest appearing in a kit repo is a build failure by policy, with exactly one sanctioned exception: the browser-driven visual-regression harness, quarantined by path inside a pinned CI container.\n\nWhat this buys is the only thing it was meant to buy. A kit app builds on a clean machine with two commands — fetch and verify the pinned tools, then compile — and produces the same bits. There is no install step whose output depends on the day you ran it, no lockfile drift, no transitive dependency tree to audit.\n\n### What it costs, written down by the decision that chose it\n\n- The Go UI ecosystem is a fraction of the JavaScript one. Some problems with off-the-shelf answers elsewhere get solved in-house here.\n- There is no living-style-guide tool for server-rendered Go, so the kit builds its own — which is also its visual-regression baseline and its acceptance harness.\n- Rich client widgets — canvas editors, advanced charts — require either an approved vendored island or doing without.\n- The tripwire is explicit: the **second** time a product feature is rejected solely because the island contract cannot express it, that earns a superseding decision record scoping a real exception, rather than cheating quietly.\n\n### The escape-hatch ladder\n\nInteractivity that server-rendered attributes cannot express climbs one rung at a time, and each rung has an admission test. Failing the test means staying on the rung below and simplifying the design.\n\n- **L0, pure attributes.** Where everything starts and where roughly ninety percent of screens end.\n- **L1, inline expressions.** Purely ephemeral view manipulation, one line, no state outliving the element — deleting it loses polish, not correctness.\n- **L2, a vendored island as a web component.** Props in via attributes, events out as custom events, one pinned file. The island is a leaf: it may not fetch, route, own durable state, or know URLs. Everything crosses the bridge.\n- **L3, a dedicated page with custom JavaScript.** Rare, and it must write its own mini decision record naming what it gives up — snapshot convergence, multi-tab — and its exit plan.\n\n### Anti-patterns are numbered so reviews can cite them\n\n- Signals as a state store, which rebuilds a single-page app inside the hypermedia layer and forks truth away from the server.\n- Per-keystroke POSTs without debounce. Loopback is fast; it is not free.\n- Optimistic UI, against both the framework's stance and a sub-millisecond round trip.\n- Client-side routing inside an app that has a real server. The browser already has a router, and every URL is a server render.\n- JSON APIs for your own UI — a second rendering engine and a schema to drift. An external API is a product decision, not a UI shortcut.\n\n### Agent legibility wins ties\n\nThe kit treats agents as first-class users, not as an audience that also happens to read the docs. Every schema is machine-readable, all kit knowledge is queryable, decision records are written for mid-task model consumption, and every scaffolded app ships a committed agent briefing plus the assistant connection so a fresh session in a fresh checkout is productive without a human priming it.\n\nThe tiebreaker is written down so it can be cited in review: when a design choice trades human convenience against agent legibility, **agent legibility wins** — the human has agents, and the agents do not have the human's memory.\n\nThe honest price sits in the same record: the docs are the API, so doc rot is platform rot. It gets CI teeth rather than good intentions — internal link checking as a hard failure, regeneration cleanliness, a missing upgrade note failing a release, and scaffold tests asserting the generated project actually contains what it promises.\n\n### Context is a budget, not a vibe\n\nAn assistant that floods a model's context is worse than no assistant — the motivating case is a documented deployment that burned 143k of a 200k-token window on tool schemas alone, before the first user query. So the return-shape rules are binding on every current and future tool:\n\n- Lists return names and one-line summaries with pagination and a has-more flag. Never source.\n- Full content comes back only by exact identifier, one item per call. No tool accepts a list of names for content retrieval.\n- Findings and steps are structured objects with stable identifiers, so agents can act on them without re-parsing prose.\n- Any response produced under fallback declares that it was.\n- Tool descriptions are capped at two sentences, and the total schema cost for the whole server is measured in CI — exceeding the ceiling is a release blocker, not a warning.\n\nThe friction is deliberate. An agent that wants five components makes five calls and feels the cost; that is the budget signal working.\n\n### Component sourcing has a priority order\n\n- Kit components first. If the kit almost has it, extend the kit — that is the propagation flywheel, not a detour.\n- The licensed commercial corpus is design vocabulary to **adapt**, never markup to paste with raw palette classes, and it ships in nothing that could ever be opened.\n- Permissively licensed component libraries are vendored into the kit once, adapted to kit tokens, and owned from then on. Upstream divergence is accepted; that is what owning your code means.\n- Never a runtime import of a third-party component library, and never CSS or JavaScript from a CDN. A component the kit did not absorb is a component the kit does not have yet.\n\n### A threat model sized to the actual threat\n\nThe baseline defends against other local processes probing the loopback port, malicious web pages mounting cross-site or DNS-rebinding attacks against a local server, untrusted content rendered into pages, tampered updates, and secrets leaking through config files or agent context. It explicitly does **not** defend against a compromised OS user account, hostile multi-tenant deployment, or a targeted attacker with local execution. Kit apps run on the owner's machines for the owner, and the baseline is sized to that and nothing more.\n\nTwo consequences of that scoping are worth naming. Secrets live in the OS keychain and config holds references, never values — which is as much an agent decision as a security one, because agents read and quote config files and must have nothing quotable. And the reactive layer requires an eval-permitting content-security policy with no nonce path available; that is accepted deliberately and documented, rather than pretended away, and what makes it acceptable is that no third-party script ever loads.\n\n### Propagation is a versioning problem\n\nOne repo, one module, semver tags from the root. Apps depend on the kit at an exact tag and adopt an improvement with a dependency bump plus an upgrade note — and every minor ships one, even when its entire body is \"no app action required\", because the upgrade tool needs something to anchor to.\n\nCopy-and-own scaffolding was rejected at the kit-to-app boundary for a specific reason: copied code receives no fixes, and templates rotting is the failure the kit was founded against. The same model is correct at the third-party-to-kit boundary, where material is vendored once, into one place, with one owner."

          "body": "## Two layers, one hard line\n\nThe design doc calls the split **Authority vs Intelligence**. The Go module compiled to WebAssembly is the authority: the single source of truth for unification, validation and export. The JavaScript layer is orchestration — virtual file paths, AST navigation, IDE integration — and the React helper is lifecycle: one instance, and the loading state around it.\n\nThe rule that falls out of that is the whole design: JavaScript never re-implements CUE semantics. It prepares state, crosses the boundary, and reports what came back.\n\n## Inside the module\n\nA simplified hexagonal split, for one specific reason. `syscall/js` only exists in a WASM build, so anything entangled with it can only be tested in a browser-like environment. The core is therefore pure Go wrapping the official CUE Go API with no WASM imports at all, and the adapter is the only code that touches `syscall/js` — it maps JS values to Go calls and hands back promises.\n\nThe bridge exposes one global with seven methods: `unify`, `validate`, `export`, `parse`, `format`, `getSymbols`, `version`. That list is the entire API surface.\n\n`unify` is the one worth reading closely. It takes an overlay — a map of absolute virtual paths to CUE content — plus an optional list of entry points and optional `key=value` tags for `@tag` injection. It returns a JSON string: either the unified result, or a structured error carrying message, line, column and file.\n\n## The tooling layer\n\n`Workspace` is the glue that prepares state for the crossing. It normalizes paths so everything starts at the root, tracks which files are entry points rather than dependencies so the load call can be narrowed to what matters, and catches path errors on the JavaScript side before the boundary is crossed at all.\n\nThe React helpers own the instance and its loading state and expose the same method set the bridge does, plus the flag that chooses the phased path.\n\n## Loading\n\nThree paths, and they differ by environment:\n\n- **Node** — read the engine binary off disk and instantiate it. No phasing; there is no network latency to hide.\n- **Browser, direct** — fetch the engine binary and instantiate it on the main thread.\n- **Browser, phased** — a worker instantiates the reader immediately, warms the engine behind it, and caches the module bytes in IndexedDB keyed by version and phase.\n\nOn the phased path the manager is a promise per message: it assigns an id, the worker answers with that id, and the manager resolves or rejects the matching caller.\n\nWhile the engine is still warming, evaluation calls do not queue. They fail with an explicit message saying the full engine is required — from the worker, and from the reader build's own Go stubs if a caller reaches them another way.\n\n## One source, two binaries\n\nThe build compiles the same entry point twice: once with a reader build tag, once without. In the reader build, unify, validate and the evaluating exports are replaced by stubs that return that structured \"requires the full engine\" message. The parser, formatter and symbol walker sit outside the tag, so they exist in both binaries and cannot drift apart. One exception is deliberate: exporting to formatted CUE is only formatting, so the reader handles it.\n\nSizes are documented rather than guessed — the reader is about 5.2MB raw and under 1MB with Brotli; the engine is about 27.1MB raw and around 6MB compressed."

          "body": "## The constraint everything answers to\n\nThe full CUE evaluator is around 30MB. That one number drives the loading design, the packaging design and, indirectly, the API surface. Every significant decision in this project is a response to it.\n\n## Bundlers must never see the binary\n\nThe named risk is a \"bundling accident\": someone imports the library the ordinary way and a 30MB binary lands in their JavaScript bundle. So the binary is never importable in a form a bundler can inline. It is fetched as an external asset — `fetch` in the browser, a file read in Node — and the package's `exports` map keeps the JavaScript entry points and the WASM asset on separate specifiers. The tooling import is documented at roughly 10KB and the loader at roughly 2KB.\n\nThe cost of that choice is that the asset has to be resolvable at runtime. That is why browser builds default to version-pinned CDN URLs instead of asking every consumer to copy binaries into their static assets — and why every one of those paths is overridable for anyone who cannot reach a third-party CDN.\n\n## Time to interactive is the metric\n\nThe performance playground rates results against RAIL bands rather than raw milliseconds: under 100ms is imperceptible, 100–300ms is responsive, 300–1000ms is noticeable but acceptable for background initialization, and past a second is lag worth fixing.\n\nAgainst those bands: a cold start is one to three seconds of download plus compile, and a hot start off the IndexedDB byte cache is under 50ms. The guide pushes the rest of the budget onto the server — preload hints so the download starts before the JavaScript is parsed, Brotli or gzip on `.wasm`, and immutable cache headers, which are only safe because the URLs carry the version.\n\n## The tradeoffs, stated plainly\n\n- Reader-first means a window where evaluation is genuinely unavailable. It errors explicitly instead of queueing, because a silent queue turns a loading state into a mystery.\n- The engine sees only the overlay it is handed, so there is no on-disk module resolution. That is the sandbox guarantee and the limitation, and they are the same property.\n- Worker plus IndexedDB is opt-in, not the default, because it changes the threading model of the host app.\n- No runtime npm dependencies, Node 18 or newer, React as a peer dependency rather than a bundled one.\n\n## What v1 had to mean\n\nThe polish tracker starts with a gap analysis written against community needs rather than the original use case: users need JSON, YAML and formatted CUE, not just one output; TypeScript types are non-negotiable; \"invalid config\" is not an error report without a line and column; and WASM is heavy, so the size has to be measured and published rather than hand-waved. Each of those became a tracked task with a status, including the binary-size measurement.\n\nThe verification surface matches that posture. The standard run is five suites — loader and worker unit logic, integration, a security regression test, an examples check and an edge-case and concurrency pass — with a Docker suite on top. CI gates on a Go lint job, then builds the WASM and runs the suite across Node 18, 20 and 22, with the Docker suite running once on the newest.\n\n## What is deliberately not built\n\nThe roadmap names four extensions and none of them are shipped: an HTTP or gRPC server wrapping the same core, so non-Go services can validate config as a sidecar or a central CI gate; a small single-binary CLI focused on data manipulation; a WASI target so the same binary runs under a server-side runtime for plugin sandboxing; and a language server over WASM for browser editors.\n\nThey are listed here because of what they say about the core: each is planned as another adapter around the existing pure-Go logic, which is the payoff the hexagonal split was chosen for."

          "body": "## One binary, one idea\n\nEverything in the runtime path is a single Go program. Its `main()` does exactly one thing: serve the provider over Pulumi's provider protocol. The engine launches it, talks to it for the length of a deployment, and every decision worth reading about happens in `provider/provider.go`.\n\nThe repo starts from Pulumi's provider boilerplate — the Makefile, the deployment templates and the scaffolding are theirs. The two files that carry the actual idea are `provider/provider.go` and `tests/provider_test.go`.\n\n## The schema is the Go types\n\nThe provider registers one resource through the `infer` layer of `pulumi-go-provider`. There is no hand-written schema document: the argument struct and the state struct are the schema.\n\n```\ntype StatefulStringArgs struct {\n    String   string            `pulumi:\"string\"`\n    Triggers map[string]string `pulumi:\"triggers\"`\n}\n```\n\nThe state struct embeds the args and adds nothing else, so `string` and `triggers` are both inputs and outputs — the value handed in is the value read back out. A module map folds `provider` into `index`, which is why the token every SDK sees is `statefulString:index:StatefulString` rather than something nested.\n\nBoth fields are plain, non-pointer values carrying pulumi tags, which makes them required everywhere downstream. The generated Go client returns `invalid value for required argument` and the TypeScript client throws `Missing required property` before a deployment ever reaches the provider process.\n\n## One comparison, two callers\n\n`Diff` and `Update` do not each hold their own opinion about what changed. Both call the same function, and that function returns three things at once: whether any trigger moved, the per-key detailed diff, and the arguments that should become the next state.\n\nThat is the design in one line. Preview and apply cannot disagree, because there is only one code path that decides.\n\n## The diff contract\n\n```\nstring     triggers        HasChanges   DetailedDiff\n---------  --------------  -----------  ----------------------\nsame       same            false        none\nchanged    same            false        none\nsame       value moved     true         triggers.KEY\nchanged    value moved     true         string, triggers.KEY\nchanged    key added       true         string, triggers.KEY\nchanged    key removed     true         string, triggers.KEY\n```\n\nRead the second row twice. A changed `string` with an unchanged trigger map is not a change. The engine is told there is nothing to do, and if `Update` runs anyway it returns the old string with the new trigger map.\n\nTrigger keys are compared one at a time — added, changed, removed — and each becomes its own `triggers.` entry keyed by the trigger name. The preview therefore names the exact key that caused a rotation instead of showing the whole map as dirty. The `string` entry only ever joins that list once a trigger has already moved.\n\nNothing in the table produces a replacement. The detailed diff emits add, update and delete kinds only; there is no replace path in the provider at all.\n\n## Four SDKs, generated from the built binary\n\nCodegen runs against the compiled provider, once per language: Go, TypeScript, Python and .NET. The binary is the source of truth for the schema, so the SDKs cannot drift away from the Go types — regenerating is the only way to change them, and the build deletes each SDK directory before it regenerates it.\n\nThe examples work the same way. One YAML program is written by hand; the per-language example programs are produced from it by `pulumi convert`. One program to maintain, four languages to demonstrate.\n\n## How it is proven\n\nThe tests host the provider in-process — no cloud, no CLI, no stack. A test server is constructed from the same `Provider()` the shipped binary serves, and the cases drive `Create`, `Update` and `Diff` directly through Pulumi property maps.\n\nThey are table-driven and named for the transition being asserted: `String Change__Triggers Same`, `String Same__Triggers Add and Delete Key and Update Value`. Every row of the contract above is a row in that table. `Update` is tested independently of `Diff`, so it cannot quietly rely on `Diff` having filtered the call out first.\n\nCI closes the loop end to end. On every push, every pull request and a nightly schedule, the workflow builds the provider inside Pulumi's own devcontainer image, installs it, stands the example stack up against a local file backend, tears it down again, and regenerates the multi-language examples. A break in the codegen or in the example programs fails the build rather than a user."

          "kind": "design",
          "body": "## The resource does not generate anything\n\nThe string is an input. `Create` stores what it was handed and uses the resource's Pulumi name as the id — no randomness, no derivation, no hidden source of truth. That is what makes the behavior worth having: the value comes from wherever the caller wants it to come from, and the resource's only job is deciding *when* that value is allowed to move.\n\n## Triggers are required, not optional\n\n`triggers` is a non-pointer map with a pulumi tag, so it is a required argument in all four generated SDKs. There is no no-triggers mode where the resource quietly degenerates into a plain string. Taking this resource means taking the rotation contract with it.\n\n## The cost of the contract\n\nThe tradeoff is real, and it is the interesting part. Editing the string in your program and running a deploy does nothing: no diff, no warning, no output change. The trigger map is the only thing that can move the value. That means:\n\n- The stored value can legitimately differ from the value written in the program, and that is not drift — it is the point.\n- Anyone reading the program has to know the rule, or they will conclude the deploy is broken.\n- Recovering from a wrong value means touching a trigger, not fixing the literal.\n\nThe test suite asserts that behavior by name, so it is a decision rather than an oversight. It trades obviousness for stability. A resource that respected the literal would be easier to explain and useless for the job.\n\n## Nothing is replaced\n\nThe detailed diff is built from three kinds only — add, update, delete — and `Update` mutates state in place. There is no replacement path anywhere in the provider, so nothing downstream gets torn down because a trigger moved.\n\n## Validation was written and backed out\n\nAn input `Check` existed. It would have rejected a missing `string` or a missing `triggers` with named check failures, and it was removed in the final commit, whose message is *removing check for now*. It is still in the file, commented out, next to the recorded actual `CheckResponse` captured while working on it, along with its matching commented-out test cases.\n\nThe practical effect is that required-ness is enforced one layer out, in the generated SDKs, and the provider accepts what reaches it. `Delete` and `Read` are not implemented either. The implemented surface is `Create`, `Update` and `Diff`; the file's own comment lists the rest of the optional lifecycle hooks that were left alone.\n\n## The environment is part of the deliverable\n\nA provider that only builds on the author's laptop is not a provider anyone can pick up, so the toolchain is declared rather than assumed:\n\n- `devbox.json` names the packages — Go, Pulumi, the Pulumi Python package, pre-commit — and `devbox.lock` records the resolved versions.\n- The dev container definition is regenerated from those same two files by `devbox generate devcontainer`, so the container installs what the shell installs.\n- pre-commit runs hygiene hooks on the way in, including `detect-private-key`, a large-file check and merge-conflict and symlink checks.\n- CI builds inside Pulumi's published devcontainer image, so the build environment is upstream's rather than a hand-rolled one.\n\nThe nightly schedule is the part that earns its keep. The build container is tracked at `latest` and the provider is pinned against `pulumi-go-provider` and the Pulumi SDK, so a scheduled run is how toolchain drift surfaces without waiting for someone to push."

          "body": "## One fact base, two faces\n\nEverything here derives from one CUE module. It holds the career fact base — granular facts, each carrying its claim, its source, a defensibility grade and a visibility level — and it is the only source of truth in the repository. Two export expressions project it: a curated public subset and the full private record. Nothing downstream reads the module itself; every consumer reads a projection.\n\nThe public face is a static site. The private face is a local-only studio for running the job search. They never share a data path. They share a source.\n\n## The wall is a projection, not a filter\n\nThe public export names exactly what it removes: applications and job-description text, mail, objectives and salary, internal annotations, any fact not marked public, model and prompt metadata, the private fact graph, and the evidence a fact would need to be upgraded. The private export is generated on demand and never committed.\n\nThe point of two expressions rather than one export plus a downstream filter is that privacy stops being a runtime behaviour. The public build embeds only the public projection, so there is nothing private in the artifact for anything — including a prompt injection against the chat — to reach.\n\nOne deliberate inclusion: a certification still in progress ships in the public set, explicitly labelled as in progress. The wall is about what is private, not about what is flattering.\n\n## Honesty is enforced in the build, not in review\n\nThe résumé pipeline is a chain of small binaries, and the interesting one is the check at the end. It runs with no model calls at all: every non-trivial prose line in every rendered artifact has to trace back to something in the public projection — the contact block, the summary, a responsibility, an education entry, a certification, a competency — or the build fails. It also refuses to publish a fact whose grade is inferred, and it enforces the invariant that `geoffmiller.cloud` appears in every format, human and machine.\n\nRenders are hash-gated. The input hash for a view-and-format cell covers the facts that view selects, the view's configuration and the renderer version, so a run rebuilds only what actually changed and logs what it skipped rather than silently truncating.\n\nA second layer of gates does use a model — ATS conformance and presentation review — under a hard process-wide spend ceiling. Those are opt-in and local. The gate that runs in CI is the deterministic one, so continuous integration needs no key, no network and no browser.\n\n## The site is generated from one route table\n\nContent is authored as CUE plus Markdown and compiled by a separate build binary into a single committed JSON artifact: export the graph, render the Markdown, validate the cross-references CUE deliberately does not, drop drafts, and report every problem at once rather than one exit code at a time. The site binary embeds that artifact and knows nothing about CUE or Markdown, which keeps its module buildable from a clean checkout with no sibling repositories on disk.\n\nEvery published page is enumerated once, in one table, and both consumers read it — the static generator writes each entry to disk and the dev server mounts each entry as a handler. The obvious alternative, a list of writes in the generator and a parallel list of handlers in the server, drifts in exactly one direction: the page works locally and is simply absent from the deploy.\n\n## Two front ends, stated plainly\n\nThe front end serving the site today is React loaded from a CDN with no build step. Its source existed in no repository until it was recovered from its own deployed artifact and committed here. The Go and templ site is its successor and is where new work happens. Both are in the repository, and describing only the second one would be a tidier story and a false one.\n\n## The chat is a separate, guarded path\n\nThe chat is the one thing on the public site that costs money to answer, so it does not run inside the static bundle. A small scale-to-zero function sits behind an API gateway; its key lives in encrypted parameter storage; its rate-limit counters and answer cache live in a managed key-value store rather than in process memory, which is what makes the deployment safe to run as more than one instance.\n\nThe client is the only JavaScript on the Go site: no framework, no build step, no dependency. It never assigns model output to `innerHTML` — the answer is generated in part from visitor input, so it is untrusted, and the small Markdown subset it supports builds DOM nodes instead. While waiting it escalates its status line, because the round trip is genuinely a few seconds and a silent spinner reads as broken. With scripting disabled, the block explains how to reach Geoff instead of rendering a dead input.\n\n## The private half\n\nThe studio is a web application that is never on the web. It binds one handler tree to the loopback interface on an ephemeral port, prints a one-shot launch token that is exchanged for a session cookie, and guards the Host header. Storage is CGO-free SQLite in WAL mode with a single writer, so the binary needs no system library and no C toolchain.\n\nIt is designed as the only writer of the fact base. Corrections are made to facts and documents are regenerated — never the other way round, because a hand-edited document drifts from the source the moment it is saved."

          "body": "## The constraints are chosen, and they are the design\n\n- **No Node, anywhere in a build chain.** Go, CUE and JSONL only. JavaScript enters a build only as a vendored, version-pinned embedded file; the stylesheet is produced by a checksum-pinned standalone Tailwind binary and committed.\n- **CUE is the contract.** Schema, site content, design tokens and the career fact base are all CUE, validated before anything renders.\n- **The private half is local-first.** Loopback, SQLite, no server, no cloud, no exceptions.\n- **Cost is a design input.** The public chat has to be structurally incapable of running up a bill.\n- **Public data is a projection, not a permission.** Two exports, not one export and a filter.\n\n## Committed artifacts, and the staleness they invite\n\nTwo generated things are committed rather than rebuilt in CI: the stylesheet and the compiled content. That is a deliberate trade. It keeps the site module buildable from a clean checkout with no Node, no sibling repository and no workspace file — the invariant CI enforces on every deploy, and one that has broken this repository's CI twice.\n\nThe cost is that a committed artifact can go stale silently. It already did. The stylesheet fell behind the templates and an architecture diagram shipped as a grid of solid black rectangles, because every fill and stroke utility resolved against a sheet that had never defined those custom properties, and an invalid fill computes to black. It read as a design problem rather than a build problem.\n\nThe fix was not a resolution to be more careful. The CSS build now writes directly into the directory the embed actually reads, so the hand-copy step that was skipped no longer exists, and a test fails when any literal class used in a template has no matching selector in the stylesheet that ships. It runs under plain `go test`, in an environment where Tailwind cannot run at all.\n\n## Retrieval: none, deliberately\n\nThe original chat design specified a retrieval index with top-K queries, a concern router and a citation lookup endpoint. The public fact base is about twenty-seven facts and under two thousand tokens. Retrieval is an optimisation for a problem this system does not have, so every fact goes into the prompt on every call: no recall risk, no top-K tuning, and the model can cite anything it is given.\n\nThe interface stays in place so growth is a swap rather than a rewrite, with the threshold for tripping it written down — roughly a hundred and fifty facts. When it trips, the first upgrade is lexical rather than semantic, because this corpus is domain jargon and lexical matching is stronger there.\n\nTwo smaller corrections came out of the same review, and both are the kind that fail silently rather than loudly: the model the original design named had already been retired, and prompt caching would have been accepted and done nothing, because the prefix sits far below the minimum cacheable size. Neither would have produced an error.\n\n## The expensive risk is not the bill\n\nRanked by impact rather than likelihood, the worst outcome for a public chat is not a surprise invoice. It is a screenshot of the assistant saying something ugly under Geoff's name. That needs no exploit, and it cannot be recalled.\n\nThat ranking sets the controls. Refuse rather than improvise: no fact, say so plainly — the honesty rule that governs the résumé governs the chat. Off-topic questions are redirected gracefully rather than punished, because a confused visitor is not an attacker and treating them as one is its own failure. A jailbreak attempt gets the same friendly redirect as an off-topic question: no accusation, no block notice, nothing to learn from. Injection screening runs ahead of the paid call. A kill switch disables the endpoint without a redeploy.\n\nThe cost controls sit underneath all of that: per-identity and global request caps, an answer cache, a concurrency cap, a capped output length, a capped input length, and a monthly budget alarm. The single-turn request shape is load-bearing — no history is accepted or sent, so per-call cost cannot grow. If multi-turn is ever added, that control dies and the cost model has to be redone.\n\n## Tailoring is selection, never invention\n\nThe generation design treats a tailored résumé as a selection problem over true facts. Every line carries the facts behind it, and a defensibility loop runs before anything renders: deterministic checks first, at zero cost, then two competing-incentive reviewers — one defending the draft as a recruiter would, one attacking it as a skeptical interviewer would. The loop exits when they agree, or it stops and hands the unresolved objections back as work for a human rather than blocking forever.\n\nThe bar it enforces is not \"impressive\". It is that Geoff could defend the line in an interview room. There is no need to stretch, so the system's job is to find the true best-fit story for a role, not to manufacture one.\n\n## A deploy that deleted the only copy\n\nThe publish workflow force-replaced its target branch on every push. That is the right shape for an artifact mirror and the wrong shape when the target holds the only copy of something. A routine push replaced the branch that had been serving the site, and that front end's source existed in no repository — the deployed artifact was the source.\n\nIt was recoverable, from a dangling commit. The change was not a note to be careful next time: the push trigger is gone, publishing is manual, and the condition for re-enabling it is written into the workflow — what gets published has to be what should be live, and the force-replace has to be gone or the target has to stop being the sole copy of anything.\n\n## Where the design and the running system disagree\n\nWorth stating, because a portfolio that only shows the tidy version is not evidence of anything.\n\n- The decision register lists every entry as proposed, pending sign-off, while several of those decisions are already enforced by the build.\n- The front end serving the site today is CDN React with no build step, which is not what the design says the site is. The Go and templ successor is built and is where new work lands.\n- The studio is designed as the only writer of the fact base. Today the facts are authored directly in CUE and the studio reads them.\n- The architecture document assigns the loopback server, the app shell and the kanban board to the platform library this project is built on. That library has not shipped them, so they live here, deliberately isolated, to be deleted when it does.\n\n## The contribute-back rule\n\nGeneric goes to the platform; brand and domain stay here. The loopback server, the app shell, the command palette, the kanban board and the card primitives are all built in this repository to graduate out of it. Everything résumé-shaped — persona lenses, fact surfaces, the brand token set — stays. It is written down as a hard requirement rather than a preference, because the payoff only exists if the rule is applied when applying it is inconvenient."
